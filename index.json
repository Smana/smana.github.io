[{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":" How are our applications performing? 👁️ Once our application is deployed, it is essential to have indicators that help identify potential issues and track performance changes. Among these sources of information, metrics and logs play an essential role by providing valuable insights into the application's operation. Additionally, it is often useful to implement detailed tracing to accurately track all actions performed within the application.\nIn this series of blog posts, we will explore the various areas of application monitoring. The goal is to thoroughly analyze the state of our applications, in order to improve their availability and performance, while ensuring an optimal user experience.\nThis first article focuses on collecting and visualizing metrics. We will deploy a scalable and high-performance solution to forward these metrics to a reliable and durable storage system. Then, we will see how to visualize them for analysis purposes.\n❓ What is a metric Definition Before collecting this so-called \u0026quot;metric\u0026quot;, let's first look at its definition and characteristics: A metric is a measurable data point that helps track the status and performance of an application. These data points are typically collected at regular intervals, such as the number of requests, memory usage, or error rates.\nWhen it comes to monitoring, it is hard to avoid hearing about Prometheus. This project has contributed to the emergence of a standard that defines how metrics are exposed, called OpenMetrics, which follows this format:\nTime Series: A unique time series is the combination of the metric's name and its labels. For instance, request_total{code=\u0026quot;200\u0026quot;} and request_total{code=\u0026quot;500\u0026quot;} are considered two distinct time series.\nLabels: Labels can be associated with a metric to provide more specific details. They are added after the metric's name using curly braces. Although optional, they are commonly used, especially in a Kubernetes context (pod, namespace, etc.).\nValue: The value is the numeric data collected at a specific point in time for a given time series. Depending on the metric type, it represents a measured or counted value that tracks a metric's evolution over time.\nTimestamp: Specifies when the data was collected (in epoch format to the millisecond). If not present, it is added when the metric is retrieved.\nThis full line is called araw sample.\nWatch out for cardinality! The more labels you have, the more possible combinations of them exist, which leads to an exponential increase in the number of time series. This total number of combinations is known as cardinality. High cardinality can significantly affect performance, especially by increasing memory usage and storage demands.\nHigh cardinality also occurs when new metrics are frequently created. This phenomenon, known as churn rate, reflects the rate at which metrics appear and disappear within a system. In the context of Kubernetes, where pods are regularly created and deleted, this churn rate can contribute to the rapid increase in cardinality.\nA Glimpse of How Metrics Are Gathered Now that we understand what a metric is, let's see how they are collected. Most modern solutions expose an endpoint that allows scraping metrics, meaning they are queried at regular intervals. For instance, using the Prometheus SDK, available in most programming languages, it's easy to expose an endpoint for metrics collection into our applications.\nThis is worth noting that Prometheus generally uses a \u0026quot;Pull\u0026quot; model, where the server periodically queries targets to retrieve metrics via these exposed endpoints. This approach helps control the frequency of data collection and prevents overloading the systems.\nLet's take an example with an Nginx web server. The server is installed via the Helm chart with Prometheus support enabled. Here, the parameter metrics.enabled=true adds a path that exposes the metrics endpoint.\n1helm install ogenki-nginx bitnami/nginx --set metrics.enabled=true Then, we can retrieve a significant number of metrics with a simple HTTP call.\n1kubectl port-forward svc/ogenki-nginx metrics \u0026amp; 2Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9113 -\u0026gt; 9113 3 4curl -s localhost:9113/metrics 5... 6# TYPE promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total counter 7promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total{code=\u0026#34;200\u0026#34;} 257 8... The curl command was just an example. Generally speaking, the metrics scrapping is carried out by a system responsible for storing this data so it can later be used.\nℹ️ When using Prometheus, an additional component is required to Push metrics from applications: PushGateway.\nIn this article, I’ve chosen to introduce you to VictoriaMetrics.\n✨ VictoriaMetrics: An Enhanced Prometheus? Like Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics is a Time Series Database (TSDB). These databases are designed to track and store events that change over time. Although VictoriaMetrics appeared a few years after Prometheus, they share many similarities: both are open-source databases licensed under Apache 2.0, dedicated to handling time series data. VictoriaMetrics remains fully compatible with Prometheus, using the same metric format, OpenMetrics, and supporting the PromQL query language.\nBoth projects are also very active, with dynamic communities and regular contributions from various companies as you can see here.\nNow, let’s explore the key differences and reasons why one might choose VictoriaMetrics:\nEfficient storage and compression: This is likely one of the major advantages, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or needing long-term retention. With Prometheus, an additional component like Thanos is needed for this purpose. VictoriaMetrics, in the other hand, has an optimized storage engine that batches and optimizes data before writing it to disk. Furthermore, it uses powerful compression algorithms, making disk space usage much more efficient compared to Prometheus.\nMemory footprint: VictoriaMetrics is said to use up to 7 times less memory than a Prometheus-based solution. However, the available benchmarks are somewhat outdated, and Prometheus has since benefited from several memory optimizations.\nMetricsQL: VictoriaMetrics extends the PromQL language with new functions. This language is also designed to be more performant, especially on large datasets.\nModular architecture: VictoriaMetrics can be deployed in two modes: \u0026quot;Single\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Cluster\u0026quot;. We’ll explore this in more detail later in the article.\nAnd much more...: The points above are the key reasons I highlighted, but there are others. VictoriaMetrics can also operate in Push mode, support multitenancy, and offers additional features available in the Enterprise version.\nCase studies: what they say about it On the VictoriaMetrics website, you'll find numerous testimonials and case studies from companies that have migrated from other systems (such as Thanos, InfluxDB, etc.). Some examples are particularly insightful, especially those from Roblox, Razorpay, and Criteo, which handle a very large volume of metrics.\n🔎 A modular and scalable architecture GitOps and Kubernetes Operators The remaining of this article comes from a set of configurations available in the repository Cloud Native Ref. It makes use of several operators, notably those for VictoriaMetrics and Grafana.\nThe aim of this project is to quickly bootstrap a complete platform that follows best practices in terms of automation, monitoring, security, and more. Comments and contributions are welcome 🙏 VictoriaMetrics can be deployed in various ways: The default mode is called Single, and as the name suggests, it involves deploying a single instance that handles read, write, and storage operations. It is recommended to start with this mode as it is optimized and meets most use cases, as explained in this section.\nSingle Mode The deployment method chosen in this article makes use of the Helm chart victoria-metrics-k8s-stack, which configures multiple resources (VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, Alertmanager, some dashboards, etc.). Below is a snippet of a Flux configuration for the Single mode.\nobservability/base/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/helmrelease-vmsingle.yaml\n1apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2 2kind: HelmRelease 3metadata: 4 name: victoria-metrics-k8s-stack 5 namespace: observability 6spec: 7 releaseName: victoria-metrics-k8s-stack 8 chart: 9 spec: 10 chart: victoria-metrics-k8s-stack 11 sourceRef: 12 kind: HelmRepository 13 name: victoria-metrics 14 namespace: observability 15 version: \u0026#34;0.25.15\u0026#34; 16... 17 values: 18 vmsingle: 19 spec: 20 retentionPeriod: \u0026#34;1d\u0026#34; # Minimal retention, for tests only 21 replicaCount: 1 22 storage: 23 accessModes: 24 - ReadWriteOnce 25 resources: 26 requests: 27 storage: 10Gi 28 extraArgs: 29 maxLabelsPerTimeseries: \u0026#34;50\u0026#34; When all the Kubernetes manifests are applied, the resulting architecture looks like this:\n🔒 Private Access: Although not directly related to metric collection, I wanted to highlight how access to the various UIs is managed. I chose to use Gateway API, which I’ve been using for some time and have covered in previous blog posts. An alternative would be to use a VictoriaMetrics component, VMAuth, which can act as a proxy for authorization and routing http requests, but I did not choose this option for now.\n👷 VMAgent: A very lightweight agent whose main function is to gather metrics and send them to a Prometheus-compatible database. Additionally, this agent can apply filters and transformations to metrics before forwarding them. If the destination is unavailable or there is insufficient memory, it can cache data on disk. VMAgent also has a web interface that lists the \u0026quot;Targets\u0026quot; being scraped.\n🔥 VMAlert \u0026amp; VMAlertManager: These components are responsible for sending notifications in case of issues (for instance when reaching a given threshold). I won’t go into further detail here as this will be covered in a future article.\n⚙️ VMsingle: This is the VictoriaMetrics database deployed as a single pod that handles all operations (reading, writing, and data persistence).\nOnce all pods are started, you can access the main VictoriaMetrics interface: VMUI. This UI provides access to a wide range of information, including the scraped metrics, the top queries, cardinality statistics, and much more.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. High Availability To ensure we never lose sight of what's happening with our applications, the monitoring platform must always remain up and running. All VictoriaMetrics components can be configured for high availability. Depending on the desired level of redundancy, several options are available.\nA straightforward approach would be to send data to two Single instances, duplicating the data in two different locations. Additionally, these instances could be deployed in two different regions.\nIt’s also recommended to deploy 2 VMAgents that scrape the same targets to ensure that no data is lost.\nDe-duplication setting In such an architecture, since multiple VMAgents are sending data and scraping the same targets, we end up with duplicate metrics. The De-duplication feature in VictoriaMetrics ensures that only one version is retained when two raw samples are identical. One parameter requires special attention: -dedup.minScrapeInterval. Only the most recent version is kept when identical raw samples are found within this time interval.\nIt is also recommended to:\nSet this parameter to a value equal to the scrape_interval defined in the Prometheus configuration. Keep the scrape_interval value consistent across all scraped services. The diagram below shows one of the many possible combinations to ensure optimal availability. ⚠️ However, it's important to consider the additional costs, not only for storage and compute, but also for network transfers between zones/regions. Sometimes, having a solid backup and restore strategy is a smarter choice 😅.\nCluster Mode As mentioned earlier, in most cases, the Single mode is more than sufficient. It has the advantage of being easy to maintain and, with vertical scaling, it can handle nearly all use cases. There is also a Cluster mode, but it is only relevant in two specific cases:\nThe need for multitenancy, for example, to isolate multiple teams or customers. When the limits of vertical scaling are reached. My configuration allows you to choose between either mode:\nobservability/base/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/kustomization.yaml\n1resources: 2... 3 4 - vm-common-helm-values-configmap.yaml 5 # Choose between single or cluster helm release 6 7 # VM Single 8 - helmrelease-vmsingle.yaml 9 - httproute-vmsingle.yaml 10 11 # VM Cluster 12 # - helmrelease-vmcluster.yaml 13 # - httproute-vmcluster.yaml In this mode, the read, write, and storage functions are separated into three distinct deployments.\n✏️ VMInsert: Distributes the data across VMStorage instances using consistent hashing based on the time series (combination of the metric name and its labels).\n💾 VMStorage: Responsible for writing data to disk and returning the requested data to VMSelect.\n📖 VMSelect: For each query, it retrieves the data from the VMStorages.\nThe main benefit of this mode is the ability to adjust scaling according to needs. For example, if more write capacity is required, you can add more VMInsert replicas.\nThe initial parameter that ensures a minimum level of redundancy is replicationFactor set to 2. Here is a snippet of the Helm values for the cluster mode.\nobservability/base/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/helmrelease-vmcluster.yaml\n1 vmcluster: 2 enabled: true 3 spec: 4 retentionPeriod: \u0026#34;10d\u0026#34; 5 replicationFactor: 2 6 vmstorage: 7 storage: 8 volumeClaimTemplate: 9 storageClassName: \u0026#34;gp3\u0026#34; 10 spec: 11 resources: 12 requests: 13 storage: 10Gi 14 resources: 15 limits: 16 cpu: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; 17 memory: 1500Mi 18 affinity: 19 podAntiAffinity: 20 requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 21 - labelSelector: 22 matchExpressions: 23 - key: \u0026#34;app.kubernetes.io/name\u0026#34; 24 operator: In 25 values: 26 - \u0026#34;vmstorage\u0026#34; 27 topologyKey: \u0026#34;kubernetes.io/hostname\u0026#34; 28 topologySpreadConstraints: 29 - labelSelector: 30 matchLabels: 31 app.kubernetes.io/name: vmstorage 32 maxSkew: 1 33 topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone 34 whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway 35 vmselect: 36 storage: 37 volumeClaimTemplate: 38 storageClassName: \u0026#34;gp3\u0026#34; \u0026#x2139;\u0026#xfe0f; It's worth noting that some of these parameters follow Kubernetes best practices, especially when using Karpenter: topologySpreadConstraints helps distribute pods across different zones, and podAntiAffinity ensures that two pods for the same service do not end up on the same node.\n🛠️ Configuration Alright, VictoriaMetrics is now deployed 👏. It's time to configure the monitoring for our applications, and for this, we'll rely on the Kubernetes operator pattern. Actually, this means declaring cCustom Resources that will be consumed by the VictoriaMetrics Operator to configure and manage VictoriaMetrics.\nThe Helm chart we used doesn't directly deploy VictoriaMetrics, but instead primarily installs the operator. This operator is responsible for creating and managing custom resources such as VMSingle or VMCluster, which define how VictoriaMetrics is deployed and configured based on the needs.\nThe role of VMServiceScrape is to declare where to scrape metrics for a given service. It relies on Kubernetes labels to identify the proper service and port.\nobservability/base/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/vmservicecrapes/karpenter.yaml\n1apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1 2kind: VMServiceScrape 3metadata: 4 name: karpenter 5 namespace: karpenter 6spec: 7 selector: 8 matchLabels: 9 app.kubernetes.io/name: karpenter 10 endpoints: 11 - port: http-metrics 12 path: /metrics 13 namespaceSelector: 14 matchNames: 15 - karpenter We can verify that the parameters are correctly configured using kubectl.\n1kubectl get services -n karpenter --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter -o yaml | grep -A 4 ports 2 ports: 3 - name: http-metrics 4 port: 8000 5 protocol: TCP 6 targetPort: http-metrics Sometimes there is no service, in which case we can specify how to identify the pods directly using VMPodScrape.\nobservability/base/flux-config/observability/vmpodscrape.yaml\n1apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1 2kind: VMPodScrape 3metadata: 4 name: flux-system 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 namespaceSelector: 8 matchNames: 9 - flux-system 10 selector: 11 matchExpressions: 12 - key: app 13 operator: In 14 values: 15 - helm-controller 16 - source-controller 17 - kustomize-controller 18 - notification-controller 19 - image-automation-controller 20 - image-reflector-controller 21 podMetricsEndpoints: 22 - targetPort: http-prom Not all of our applications are necessarily deployed on Kubernetes. The VMScrapeConfig resource in VictoriaMetrics allows the use of several \u0026quot;Service Discovery\u0026quot; methods. This resource offers flexibility in defining how to scrape targets via different discovery mechanisms, such as EC2 instances (AWS), cloud services, or other systems. In the example below, we use the custom tag observability:node-exporter and apply label transformations, allowing us to collect metrics exposed by node-exporters installed on these instances.\nobservability/base/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/vmscrapeconfigs/ec2.yaml\n1apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1 2kind: VMScrapeConfig 3metadata: 4 name: aws-ec2-node-exporter 5 namespace: observability 6spec: 7 ec2SDConfigs: 8 - region: ${region} 9 port: 9100 10 filters: 11 - name: tag:observability:node-exporter 12 values: [\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;] 13 relabelConfigs: 14 - action: replace 15 source_labels: [__meta_ec2_tag_Name] 16 target_label: ec2_name 17 - action: replace 18 source_labels: [__meta_ec2_tag_app] 19 target_label: ec2_application 20 - action: replace 21 source_labels: [__meta_ec2_availability_zone] 22 target_label: ec2_az 23 - action: replace 24 source_labels: [__meta_ec2_instance_id] 25 target_label: ec2_id 26 - action: replace 27 source_labels: [__meta_ec2_region] 28 target_label: ec2_region ℹ️ If you were already using the Prometheus Operator, migrating to VictoriaMetrics is very simple because it is fully compatible with the CRDs defined by the Prometheus Operator.\n📈 Visualizing Metrics with the Grafana Operator It's easy to guess what the Grafana Operator does: It uses Kubernetes resources to configure Grafana 😝. It allows you to deploy Grafana instances, add datasources, import dashboards from various sources (URL, JSON), organize them into folders, and more... This offers an alternative to defining everything in the Helm chart or using configmaps, and in my opinion, provides better readability. In this example, I group all the resources related to monitoring Cilium.\n1tree infrastructure/base/cilium/ 2infrastructure/base/cilium/ 3├── grafana-dashboards.yaml 4├── grafana-folder.yaml 5├── httproute-hubble-ui.yaml 6├── kustomization.yaml 7├── vmrules.yaml 8└── vmservicescrapes.yaml Defining the Folder is super straightforward.\nobservability/base/infrastructure/cilium/grafana-folder.yaml\n1apiVersion: grafana.integreatly.org/v1beta1 2kind: GrafanaFolder 3metadata: 4 name: cilium 5spec: 6 allowCrossNamespaceImport: true 7 instanceSelector: 8 matchLabels: 9 dashboards: \u0026#34;grafana\u0026#34; Here is a Dashboard resource that fetches the configuration from an HTTP link.

Therefore, we have to tell to the Grafana Operator where are the credentials so it can apply changes to this instance.\nobservability/base/grafana-operator/grafana-victoriametrics.yaml\n1apiVersion: grafana.integreatly.org/v1beta1 2kind: Grafana 3metadata: 4 name: grafana-victoriametrics 5 labels: 6 dashboards: \u0026#34;grafana\u0026#34; 7spec: 8 external: 9 url: http://victoria-metrics-k8s-stack-grafana 10 adminPassword: 11 name: victoria-metrics-k8s-stack-grafana-admin 12 key: admin-password 13 adminUser: 14 name: victoria-metrics-k8s-stack-grafana-admin 15 key: admin-user Finally, we can use Grafana and explore our various dashboards 🎉!\nYour browser does not support the video tag. 💭 Final Thoughts Based on the various articles reviewed, one of the main reasons to migrate to or choose VictoriaMetrics is generally better performances. However, it’s wise to remain cautious, as benchmark results depend on several factors and the specific goals in mind. This is why it's highly recommended to run your own tests. VictoriaMetrics provides a benchmarking tool that can be used on Prometheus-compatible TSDBs.\nAs you can see, today my preference is for VictoriaMetrics for metrics collection, as I appreciate the modular architecture with a variety of combinations depending on the evolving needs. However, a solution using the Prometheus Operator works perfectly fine in most cases and has the advantage of being governed by a foundation.\nAdditionally, it's important to note that some features are only available in the Enterprise version, such as downsampling, which is highly useful when wanting to retain a large amount of data over the long term.\nIn this article, we highlighted the ease of implementation to achieve a solution that efficiently collects and visualizes metrics. This is done while using the Kubernetes operator pattern,the \u0026quot;GitOps way\u0026quot;, allowing the declaration of various resources through Custom Resources. For instance, a developer can easily include a VMServiceScrape and a VMRule in their manifests, thus embedding the observability culture within the application delivery processes.\nHaving metrics is great, but is it enough? We'll try to answer that in the upcoming articles...\n🔖 References Articles sur VictoriaMetrics ","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/series/observability/metrics/","section":"post","tags":["observability"],"title":"Harness the Power of `VictoriaMetrics` and `Grafana` Operators for Metrics Management"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Index"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/observability/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Observability"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/series/observability/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Observability"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"Dagger is an open-source project that promises to revolutionize the way continuous integration (CI) pipelines are defined. It was created by the founders of Docker, based on a study of common challenges faced by companies. They identified a lack of effective tooling throughout the development cycle up to production deployment.\nOne significant issue is the lack of consistency across execution environments. You have probably heard a colleague complain with something like: \u0026quot;It worked fine on my machine! What is this error on the CI?\u0026quot; 😆\nBy offering a common and centralized method, Dagger could be THE solution to this problem. It aims to improve the local developer experience, enhance collaboration, and accelerate the development cycle.\nMany of us have used bash scripts, Makefiles, and other traditional methods to automate some actions. However, these solutions can quickly become complex and hard to maintain. Dagger offers a modern and simplified alternative, allowing us to standardize and unify our pipelines regardless of the environment.\nSo, what are the main features of Dagger, and how can it be used effectively?\n🎯 Our target Here are the points we will cover in this article:\nFirst, we will understand how Dagger works and take our get started with it.\nNext, we will explore concrete use cases for its implementation. We will see how to transform an existing project, and I will also introduce a module that I now use on a daily basis.\nFinally, we will describe an effective caching solution that will allow us to scale with Dagger.\n🔎 First steps Basically, Dagger is a tool that allows us to define tasks using our preferred language and make that code portable. In other words, what I run on my machine will be executed in the same way on the CI or on my colleague's computer.\nThere are two main components involved:\nThe Dagger CLI: Our main access point for interacting with various functions and modules, downloading them, and displaying their execution results. The Dagger engine: All operations performed with the CLI go through a GraphQL API exposed by a Dagger engine. Each client establishes its own session with the Core API, which offers basic functions. These functions can be extended using additional modules (which will be explained later). Local dagger engine The first time we run Dagger, it pulls and starts a local instance of the Dagger engine. It will therefore run a local API.\n1docker ps 2CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 33cec5bf51843 registry.dagger.io/engine:v0.12.1 \u0026#34;dagger-entrypoint.s…\u0026#34; 8 days ago Up 2 hours dagger-engine-ceb38152f96f1298 Let's start by installing the CLI.

We will gradually transform this project by injecting Dagger into it 💉. This iterative, step-by-step approach can also be applied to larger projects to progressively integrate Dagger. Our first function 👶 Our priority will be to test the code using the go test command.\nLet's start by initializing the git repo to generate the required directory structure for executing Dagger functions.\n1git clone https://github.com/Smana/golang-helloworld.git 2cd golang-helloworld 3dagger init --sdk=go 1ls -l dagger* 2.rw-r--r-- 101 smana 28 Jun 21:54 dagger.json 3 4dagger: 5.rw------- 25k smana 28 Jun 21:54 dagger.gen.go 6drwxr-xr-x - smana 28 Jun 21:54 internal 7.rw------- 1.4k smana 28 Jun 21:54 main.go The init command generates a main.go file containing example functions that we will completely replace with the following code:\n1package main 2 3import ( 4\t\u0026#34;context\u0026#34; 5) 6 7type GolangHelloworld struct{} 8 9// Test runs the tests for the GolangHelloworld project 10func (m *GolangHelloworld) Test(ctx context.Context, source *Directory) (string, error) { 11\tctr := dag.Container().From(\u0026#34;golang:1.22\u0026#34;) 12\treturn ctr. 13\tWithWorkdir(\u0026#34;/src\u0026#34;). 14\tWithMountedDirectory(\u0026#34;/src\u0026#34;, source). 15\tWithExec([]string{\u0026#34;go\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./...\u0026#34;}). 16\tStdout(ctx) 17} This is a very simple function:\nThe function, called Test, takes a source directory as a parameter. We use a golang:1.22 image. The code from the given directory is mounted in the /src folder of the container. Then, we run the go test ./... command on the source directory. Finally, we retrieve the test results (stdout). Update the local dev environment It is sometimes necessary to run the following command to update the Dagger files (dependencies, etc.).\n1dagger develop Let's test our code!\n1dagger call test --source \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; 2? helloworld/cmd/helloworld [no test files] 3? helloworld/dagger [no test files] 4? helloworld/dagger/internal/dagger [no test files] 5? helloworld/dagger/internal/querybuilder [no test files] 6? helloworld/dagger/internal/telemetry [no test files] 7ok helloworld/internal/server 0.004s \u0026#x2139;\u0026#xfe0f; The first run takes time because it downloads the image and installs the Go dependencies, but subsequent runs are much faster. We will discuss about caching later in this article.\nWhat about my docker-compose? 🐳 In this demo repository we used to run Docker Compose in order to test the application locally.\nThe docker-compose up --build command performs several actions: it builds the Docker image using the local Dockerfile, then starts two containers: one for the application and one for the database. It also enables communication between these two containers.\n1docker ps 2CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 3a1673d56f9c8 golang-helloworld-app \u0026#34;/app/main\u0026#34; 3 seconds ago Up 3 seconds 0.0.0.0:8080-\u0026gt;8080/tcp, :::8080-\u0026gt;8080/tcp golang-helloworld-app-1 4bb3dee1305dc postgres:16 \u0026#34;docker-entrypoint.s…\u0026#34; 3 seconds ago Up 3 seconds 0.0.0.0:5432-\u0026gt;5432/tcp, :::5432-\u0026gt;5432/tcp golang-helloworld-database-1 You can then access the application and store words in the database.\n1curl -X POST -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;word\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; -H \u0026#34;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#34; http://localhost:8080/store 2 3curl http://localhost:8080/list 4[\u0026#34;foobar\u0026#34;] How to achieve the same with Dagger?\nFirst, we will build the image:\n1// Build the Docker container 2func (m *GolangHelloworld) Build(ctx context.Context, source *Directory) *Container { 3\t// build the binary 4\tbuilder := dag.Container(). 5\tFrom(golangImage). 6\tWithDirectory(\u0026#34;/src\u0026#34;, source). 7\tWithWorkdir(\u0026#34;/src\u0026#34;). 8\tWithEnvVariable(\u0026#34;CGO_ENABLED\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;). 9\tWithExec([]string{\u0026#34;go\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-o\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;helloworld\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cmd/helloworld/main.go\u0026#34;}) 10 11\t// Create the target image with the binary 12\ttargetImage := dag.Container(). 13\tFrom(alpineImage). 14\tWithFile(\u0026#34;/bin/helloworld\u0026#34;, builder.File(\u0026#34;/src/helloworld\u0026#34;), ContainerWithFileOpts{Permissions: 0700, Owner: \u0026#34;nobody\u0026#34;}). 15\tWithUser(\u0026#34;nobody:nobody\u0026#34;). 16\tWithEntrypoint([]string{\u0026#34;/bin/helloworld\u0026#34;}) 17 18\treturn targetImage 19} This code demonstrates the use of \u0026quot;multi-stage build\u0026quot; to optimize the security and size of the image. This method allows us to include only what is necessary in the final image, thereby reducing the attack surface and the image size.\nNext, we need a PostgreSQL instance. Fortunately, there is a module for that ®!\nWe will install this dependency to use its functions directly in our code.\n1dagger install github.com/quartz-technology/daggerverse/postgres@v0.0.3 The Database() function allows to run a Postrges container.\n1... 2\topts := PostgresOpts{ 3\tDbName: dbName, 4\tCache: cache, 5\tVersion: \u0026#34;13\u0026#34;, 6\tConfigFile: nil, 7\tInitScript: initScriptDir, 8\t} 9 10... 11\tpgCtr := dag.Postgres(pgUser, pgPass, pgPortInt, opts).Database() Finally, we need to create a link between these two containers. Below, we retrieve the information from the service exposed by the Postgres container in order to use it in our application.\n1... 2\tpgSvc := pgCtr.AsService() 3 4\tpgHostname, err := pgSvc.Hostname(ctx) 5\tif err != nil { 6\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;could not get postgres hostname: %w\u0026#34;, err) 7\t} 8 9\treturn ctr. 10\tWithSecretVariable(\u0026#34;PGPASSWORD\u0026#34;, pgPass). 11\tWithSecretVariable(\u0026#34;PGUSER\u0026#34;, pgUser). 12\tWithEnvVariable(\u0026#34;PGHOST\u0026#34;, pgHostname). 13\tWithEnvVariable(\u0026#34;PGDATABASE\u0026#34;, opts.DbName). 14\tWithEnvVariable(\u0026#34;PGPORT\u0026#34;, pgPort). 15\tWithServiceBinding(\u0026#34;database\u0026#34;, pgSvc). 16\tWithExposedPort(8080), nil 17... Secrets 🔒 Sensitive information can be passed when calling Dagger functions in several ways: environment variables, reading the contents of files, or the output of a command line.\nup allows local calls to the services exposed by the container.\n1export PGUSER=\u0026#34;user\u0026#34; 2export PGPASS=\u0026#34;password\u0026#34; 3dagger call serve --pg-user=env:PGUSER --pg-pass=env:PGPASS --source \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; as-service up 4 5... 6 ● start /bin/helloworld 30.7s 7 ┃ 2024/06/30 08:27:50 Starting server on :8080 8 ┃ 2024/06/30 08:27:50 Starting server on :8080 Et voilà! We can now test our application locally.\nMore Functions I have intentionally truncated these last excerpts, but I invite you to check out the complete configuration here. There you will find, among other things, the ability to publish the image to a registry.\nAdditionally, I recommend browsing the Cookbook in the Dagger documentation, where you will find many examples.\n🧩 The Kubeconform Module The first module I wrote is based on a real use case: For several years, I have been using a bash script to validate Kubernetes/Kustomize manifests and the Flux configuration. The idea is to achieve the same results but also go a bit further...\nInitializing a module is done as follows:\n1dagger init --name=kubeconform --sdk=go kubeconform Next, we need to decide on the input parameters. For example, I want to be able to choose the version of the Kubeconform binary.\n1... 2\t// Kubeconform version to use for validation. 3\t// +optional 4\t// +default=\u0026#34;v0.6.6\u0026#34; 5\tversion string, 6... The above comments are important: The description will be displayed to the user, and we can make this parameter optional and set a default version.\n1dagger call -m github.com/Smana/daggerverse/kubeconform@v0.1.0 validate --help 2Validate the Kubernetes manifests in the provided directory and optional source CRDs directories 3... 4 --version string Kubeconform version to use for validation. (default \u0026#34;v0.6.6\u0026#34;) While developing this module, I went through several iterations and received very useful information on Dagger's Discord. It's a great way to interact with the community.\nLet's analyze this, for example:\n1kubeconformBin := dag.Arc(). 2 Unarchive(dag.HTTP(fmt.Sprintf(\u0026#34;https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/download/%s/kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz\u0026#34;, kubeconform_version)). 3 WithName(\u0026#34;kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz\u0026#34;)).File(\u0026#34;kubeconform-linux-amd64/kubeconform\u0026#34;) I use the Arc module to extract an archive retrieved with the HTTP function, and I only take the binary included in this archive. Pretty efficient!\nIn this other example, I use the Apko module to build\n1ctr := dag.Apko().Wolfi([]string{\u0026#34;bash\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;curl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kustomize\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;py3-pip\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;yq\u0026#34;}). 2 WithExec([]string{\u0026#34;pip\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;install\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pyyaml\u0026#34;}) At the time of writing this article, the Kubeconform module also includes a bit of bash script, primarily to efficiently traverse the directory structure and execute kubeconform.\n1\tscriptContent := `#!/bin/bash 2... 3` 4 5\t// Add the manifests and the script to the container 6\tctr = ctr. 7\tWithMountedDirectory(\u0026#34;/work\u0026#34;, manifests). 8\tWithNewFile(\u0026#34;/work/run_kubeconform.sh\u0026#34;, ContainerWithNewFileOpts{ 9\tPermissions: 0750, 10\tContents: scriptContent, 11\t}) 12 13\t// Execute the script 14\tkubeconform_command := []string{\u0026#34;bash\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/work/run_kubeconform.sh\u0026#34;} 15... To test and debug the module, we can run it locally on a repository that contains Kubernetes manifests.\n1dagger call validate --manifests ~/Sources/demo-cloud-native-ref/clusters --catalog 2... 3Summary: 1 resource found in 1 file - Valid: 1, Invalid: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0 4Validation successful for ./mycluster-0/crds.yaml 5Processing file: ./mycluster-0/flux-config.yaml 6Summary: 1 resource found in 1 file - Valid: 1, Invalid: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0 7Validation successful for ./mycluster-0/flux-config.yaml For debugging purposes, we can increase the verbosity level as follows.

By using the -i or --interactive parameter, it is possible to automatically launch a terminal when the code encounters an error. This allows for performing checks and operations directly within the container.\nAdditionally, you can insert the execution of Terminal() at any point in the container definition to enter interactive mode at that precise moment.\n1... 2\tstdout, err := ctr.WithExec(kubeconform_command). 3\tTerminal(). 4\tStdout(ctx) 5... With this module, I was also able to add some missing features that are quite useful:\nConvert all CRDs to JSONSchemas to validate 100% of Kubernetes manifests. Make it compatible with Flux variable substitutions. Finally, I was able to share it in the Daggerverse and update my CI workflows on GitHub Actions.\nNow that we have an overview of what Dagger is and how to use it, we will explore how to optimize its use in a business setting with a shared cache.\n🚀 Rapid Iteration and Collaboration with a shared cache Using a cache allows you to avoid re-executing steps where the code hasn't changed. During the first run, all steps will be executed, but subsequent runs will only re-run the modified steps, saving a significant amount of time.\nDagger allows caching, at each run, of file manipulation operations, container builds, test executions, code compilation, and volumes that must be explicitly defined in the code.\nThe following proposal aims to define a shared and remote cache, accessible to all collaborators as well as from the CI. The goal is to speed up subsequent executions, no matter where Dagger is run.\nWe will see how to put this into practice with:\nGitHub Runners executed privately on our platform (Self-Hosted) A centralized Dagger engine Cloud Native Reference This CI on EKS solution is deployed using the repository Cloud Native Ref. I strongly encourage you to check it out, as I cover many topics related to Cloud Native technologies. The initial idea of this project is to be able to quickly start a platform from scratch that applies best practices in terms of automation, monitoring, security, etc. Comments and contributions are welcome 🙏. Here is how the CI components interact, with Dagger playing a central role thanks to the shared cache.\n🤖 GitHub Actions and Self-Hosted Runners Dagger integrates well with most CI platforms. Indeed we just need to run a dagger command. In this article, we use the Action for GitHub Actions.\n1 kubernetes-validation: 2 name: Kubernetes validation ☸ 3 runs-on: ubuntu-latest 4 steps: 5 - name: Checkout 6 uses: actions/checkout@v4 7 8 - name: Validate Flux clusters manifests 9 uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v6 10 with: 11 version: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34; 12 verb: call 13 module: github.com/Smana/daggerverse/kubeconform@kubeconform/v0.1.0 14 args: validate --manifests \u0026#34;./clusters\u0026#34; --catalog This job downloads the source code from the git repo and runs the kubeconform module. While this works very well, it is important to note that this job runs on runners provided by GitHub on their infrastructure.\nGitHub self-hosted runners are machines that you configure to run GitHub Actions workflows on your own infrastructure, rather than using runners hosted by GitHub. They offer more control and flexibility, allowing you to customize the execution environment according to your specific needs. This can lead to improved performance and allows secure access to private resources.\nA Scale set is a group of GitHub runners that share a common configuration: .github/workflows/ci.yaml\n1apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2 2kind: HelmRelease 3metadata: 4 name: dagger-gha-runner-scale-set 5spec: 6 releaseName: dagger-gha-runner-scale-set 7... 8 values: 9 runnerGroup: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; 10 githubConfigUrl: \u0026#34;https://github.com/Smana/demo-cloud-native-ref\u0026#34; 11 githubConfigSecret: gha-runner-scale-set 12 maxRunners: 5 13 14 containerMode: 15 type: \u0026#34;dind\u0026#34; This scale set is configured for the Cloud Native Ref repo. It requires a secret where the parameters of the GitHub App are configured. dind indicates the mode used to launch the containers. ⚠️ However, be cautious in terms of security: Dagger must run as a root user and have elevated privileges in order to control containers, volumes, networks, etc. (More information here). ☸️ EKS Considerations There are several approaches when it comes to cache optimization, each with its own pros and cons. There are really interesting discussions about running Dagger at scale here. I made some choices that I believe are a good compromise between availability and performance. Here are the main points:\nThe Dagger Engine: A single pod exposes an HTTP service.\nSpecific Node Pool: A node pool with constraints to obtain local NVME disks.\n1 - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-local-nvme 2 operator: Gt 3 values: [\u0026#34;100\u0026#34;] 4 - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category 5 operator: In 6 values: [\u0026#34;c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;m\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;] 7 taints: 8 - key: ogenki/io 9 value: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; 10 effect: NoSchedule Container Mount Points: When a node starts, it runs the /usr/bin/setup-local-disks raid0 command. This command prepares the disks by creating a raid0 array and mounts the container file systems on it. Thus, all this space is directly accessible from the pod!\n⚠️ Note that this is an ephemeral volume: data is lost when the pod is stopped. We make use of this rapid storage for the Dagger cache.\n1... 2 - name: varlibdagger 3 ephemeral: 4 volumeClaimTemplate: 5 spec: 6 accessModes: [\u0026#34;ReadWriteOnce\u0026#34;] 7 resources: 8 requests: 9 storage: 10Gi 10 - name: varrundagger 11 ephemeral: 12 volumeClaimTemplate: 13 spec: 14 accessModes: [\u0026#34;ReadWriteOnce\u0026#34;] 15 resources: 16 requests: 17 storage: 90Gi 18... 1kubectl exec -ti -n tooling dagger-engine-c746bd8b8-b2x6z -- /bin/sh 2/ # df -h | grep nvme 3/dev/nvme3n1 9.7G 128.0K 9.7G 0% /var/lib/dagger 4/dev/nvme2n1 88.0G 24.0K 88.0G 0% /run/buildkit Best Practices with Karpenter: To optimize the availability of the Dagger engine, we configured it with a Pod Disruption Budget and the annotation karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;. Additionally, it is preferable to use On-demand instances, which we could consider reserving from AWS to obtain a discount.\nNetwork Policies: Since the runners can execute any code, it is highly recommended to limit network traffic to the bare minimum, for both the self-hosted runners and the Dagger engine. Furthermore, this is worth noting that Dagger currently listens using plain HTTP.\nTo test this, we will run a job that creates a container and installs many relatively heavy packages. The idea is to simulate a build which takes a few minutes.\n.github/workflows/ci.yaml\n1 test-cache: 2 name: Testing in-cluster cache 3 runs-on: dagger-gha-runner-scale-set 4 container: 5 image: smana/dagger-cli:v0.12.1 6 env: 7 _EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST: \u0026#34;tcp://dagger-engine:8080\u0026#34; 8 cloud-token: ${{ secrets.DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN }} 9 10 steps: 11 - name: Simulate a build with heavy packages 12 uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v6 13 with: 14 version: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34; 15 verb: call 16 module: github.com/shykes/daggerverse.git/wolfi@dfb1f91fa463b779021d65011f0060f7decda0ba 17 args: container --packages \u0026#34;python3,py3-pip,go,rust,clang\u0026#34; ℹ️ Accessing the remote Dagger engine endpoint is controlled by the environment variable _EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST\nDuring the first run, the job takes 3min and 37secs.\nHowever, any subsequent execution will be much faster (10secs)! 🎉 🚀 🥳\nLocally 💻, I can also benefit from this cache by configuring my environment like this:\n1kubectl port-forward -n tooling svc/dagger-engine 8080 2_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST=\u0026#34;tcp://127.0.0.1:8080\u0026#34; My local tests will also be accessible by the CI, and another developer taking over my work won't have to rebuild everything from scratch.\nAttention ➕ This solution has the huge advantage of ultra fast storage! Additionally, the architecture is very simple: a single Dagger engine with local storage that exposes a service.\n➖ ⚠️ However, it's far from perfect: you have to accept that this cache is ephemeral despite the precautions taken to increase the level of availability. Also, you need to consider the cost of an instance that runs all the time; scaling can only be done by using a larger machine.\nDagger Cloud Dagger Cloud is an enterprise solution that provides a very neat visualization of pipelines execution, with the ability to browse all steps and quickly identify any issues (see below). It's free for individual use, and I encourage you to try it out. This offering also provides an alternative to the solution proposed above: a distributed cache managed by Dagger. (More information here) Your browser does not support the video tag. 💭 Final Thoughts This article introduced you to Dagger and its main features that I have used. My experience was limited to the Golang SDK, but the experience should be similar with other languages. I learn new things every day. The initial learning curve can be steep, especially for non-developers like me, but the more I use Dagger in real scenarios, the more comfortable I become. In fact, I've successfully migrated 100% of my CI to Dagger.\nDagger is a relatively new project that evolves quickly, supported by an ever-growing and active community. The scaling issues discussed in this article will likely be improved in the future.\nRegarding the modules available in the Daggerverse, it can be challenging to judge their quality. There are no \u0026quot;validated\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;official\u0026quot; modules, so you often need to test several, analyze the code, and sometimes create your own.\nI transitioned from Makefile to Task, and now I hope to go further with Dagger. I aim to build more complex pipelines, like restoring and verifying a Vault backup or creating and testing an EKS cluster before destroying it. In any case, Dagger is now part of my toolkit, and you should try it out to form your own opinion! \u0026#x2705;\n🔖 References Doc Discord Youtube ","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/dagger-intro/","section":"post","tags":["devxp"],"title":"`Dagger`: The missing piece of the developer experience?"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/devxp/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Devxp"},{"body":"TLS encryption is an essential standard in securing services and applications, whether on the internet or within an enterprise. On the internet, using a TLS certificate validated by a recognized certification authority is crucial to ensure the confidentiality of data exchanges.\nFor internal communications, a private PKI (Private Public Key Infrastructure) plays a critical role in distributing and validating the certificates necessary for encrypting communications within the enterprise, thus ensuring enhanced security.\nIn this article, we will delve into setting up an effective and robust management of TLS certificates within an enterprise. We will explore best practices, tools, and strategies for a reliable certificate infrastructure.\n🎯 Our target In order to allow users to access to our applications, we will use the Gateway API standard. (You may want to have a look at my previous article on the topic.) In the architecture presented above, one component plays a major role: Cert-manager. Indeed, it is the central engine that will handle the generation and renewal of certificates. For applications intended to remain internal and not exposed on the internet, we will opt for generating certificates via a private PKI with HashiCorp's Vault. On the other hand, for public applications, we will use certificates issued by Let's Encrypt. 🛂 About Let's Encrypt Based on the ACME protocol (Automatic Certificate Management Environment), this solution enables automatic installation and renewal of certificates.\nLet's Encrypt is simple to implement, free, and enhances security. However, it's important to note that the certificates have a short duration, requiring frequent renewals.\nFor more information on how it works, you can refer to this documentation. 🔐 A private PKI with Vault A private PKI, or Private Public Key Infrastructure, is a cryptographic system used within an organization to secure data and communications. It relies on an internal Certification Authority (CA) that issues organization-specific TLS certificates.\nThis system enables an organization to:\nFully control the identity verification and authentication procedures, and to issue certificates for internal domains, which is not feasible with Let's Encrypt. Secure internal communications and data with strong authentication and encryption within the organization. However, implementing such an infrastructure requires careful attention and the management of multiple components. Here, we'll explore one of the main features of Vault, which is initially a secret management tool but can also serve as a private PKI.\nAn opiniated Cloud Native platform All the actions performed in this post come from this git repository\nIt contains the Opentofu code for deploying and configuring Vault as well as numerous resources that help me write my blog posts. Feel free to provide feedback or open issues... 🙏\n✅ Requirements Three-tier PKI A three-tier PKI consists of a Root Certificate Authority (CA) at the top, Intermediate CAs in the middle, and End Entities at the bottom. The Root CA issues certificates to the Intermediate CAs, and the Intermediate CAs to End Entities which in turn issue certificates to end users or devices. This structure enhances security by minimizing the Root CA's exposure and simplifies management and revocation of certificates, offering a scalable and flexible solution for digital security. To enhance the security of the certificate management system, it's recommended to create an offline Root Certification Authority (Root CA). Therefore, we need to complete the following steps beforehand:\nGenerate the Offline Root Certification Authority: This approach minimizes security risks by isolating the Root CA from the network.\nCreate an Intermediate Certification Authority: It operates under the Root CA's authority and is used to issue certificates, allowing for more flexible and secure management.\nGenerate the certificate for the Vault server from the Intermediate CA: This ensures a trust chain from the Root CA to the end-user certificates, through the Intermediate CA.\nBy following the procedure described here, you should obtain the following files which will be used throughout the rest of this article. This is a suggestion based on openssl, and you may use the method that best suits you to achieve the same outcome.\n1cd opentofu/openbao/cluster 2 3ls .tls/*.pem 4.tls/bundle.pem .tls/ca-chain.pem .tls/intermediate-ca-key.pem .tls/intermediate-ca.pem .tls/root-ca-key.pem .tls/root-ca.pem .tls/vault-key.pem .tls/vault.pem 🏗️ Building the cluster There are several methods to deploy a Vault cluster, but I couldn't find one that suited me, so I built my own by making the following decisions:\nIntegrated storage based on the Raft protocol, which is particularly suited for distributed systems and ensures high resilience. Below is a table illustrating fault tolerance depending on the cluster size:\nCluster size Failure tolerance 1 0 3 1 5 2 7 3 I chose to run a Vault cluster that consists of 5 members, allowing to tolerate the failure of 2 nodes.\nEphemeral node strategy with SPOT instances: The architecture exclusively comprises SPOT instances for optimal cost efficiency. The Autoscaling Group is configured with three distinct SPOT instance pools, each utilizing a different instance type. This strategic diversification aims to mitigate any potential failure due to a specific SPOT instance type shortage, thus ensuring high availability and a service continuity while maximizing cost efficiency.\nVault Auto-Unseal feature: This function is crucial given the ephemeral nature of our nodes. It minimizes downtime and eliminates the need for manual interventions for Vault unsealing.\nThis article does not aim to describe all the steps, which are available in the GitHub repo documentation. Here is an example of Opentofu variables:\n1name = \u0026#34;ogenki-vault\u0026#34; 2leader_tls_servername = \u0026#34;vault.priv.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 3domain_name = \u0026#34;priv.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 4env = \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34; 5mode = \u0026#34;ha\u0026#34; 6region = \u0026#34;eu-west-3\u0026#34; 7enable_ssm = true 8 9# Use hardened AMI 10ami_owner = \u0026#34;xxx\u0026#34; # Compte AWS où se trouve l\u0026#39;AMI 11ami_filter = { 12 \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; = [\u0026#34;*hardened-ubuntu-*\u0026#34;] 13} After completing all the steps, Vault can be accessed, and we end up with a cluster consisting of 5 nodes.\n🛠️ Configuration Deploying a complete platform is carried out sequentially, in distinct steps, because some operations must be done manually to ensure optimal security: The generation of the root certificate, which must be kept offline, and the initialization of Vault with the initial root token.\nObviously, supporting resources such as network components are required to deploy machines, then the Vault cluster can be installed and configured before considering the addition of other infrastructure elements, which will likely depend on the sensitive information stored in Vault.\nThe Vault configuration is applied using the Terraform provider, which authenticates using a token generated from the Vault instance. The proposal here demonstrates how to configure the PKI and allow internal applications to access to Vault's API, particularly on how to configure Cert-Manager.\nHere are the organization's specific variables:\n1domain_name = \u0026#34;priv.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 2pki_common_name = \u0026#34;Ogenki Vault Issuer\u0026#34; 3pki_country = \u0026#34;France\u0026#34; 4pki_organization = \u0026#34;Ogenki\u0026#34; 5pki_domains = [ 6 \u0026#34;cluster.local\u0026#34;, 7 \u0026#34;priv.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 8] After following the procedure, the PKI is configured, and we can generate certificates.\nInstall the private CA on machines Unlike public PKIs, where certificates are automatically trusted by client software, in a private PKI, the certificates need to be manually approved and installed on users devices.\nUbuntu Archlinux macOS Windows Server 💾 Scheduled Backups Like any solution holding data, it is crucial to back it up. Especially for Vault which contains sensitive data: Regular backups to a secure location are therefore necessary. The solution proposed here is simply a Cronjob. It uses Crossplane to provision AWS resources and is broken down as follows:\nAn S3 bucket for storing the snapshots A lifecycle policy to keep only the last 30 backups. The bucket is encrypted with a specific KMS key. An external-secret to retrieve the authentication parameters of the Approle specific to the Cronjob. A Cronjob that executes the script available in the repo and performs a snapshot as described in Hashicorp's documentation. An IRSA role that grants the pod permissions to write the snapshots to S3. 🚀 TLS with Gateway API The aim of this post is to demonstrate practical usage with Gateway-API and, depending on the protocol used, several options are available for securing connections with TLS. For instance, we can use Passthrough to set TLS termination at the upstream (directly exposed by the pod). However, for our use case, we will use the most common scenario: HTTPS at the Gateway level.\nBasically we only need to specify a Kubernetes secret that stores the certificate.\n1listeners: 2- protocol: HTTPS 3 port: 443 4 tls: 5 mode: Terminate 6 certificateRefs: 7 - name: foobar-tls Let's look into this in detail, as there are a few preliminary steps in order to obtain these secrets 🔍.\n☁️ A Public Certificate Info Cert-Manager is an open-source tool for managing TLS certificates in Kubernetes. It is basically a Kubernetes operator that is controlled through the use of CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions): it is indeed possible to generate certificates by creating resources of type certificate. Cert-manager then takes care of ensuring they are always valid and initiates a renewal when necessary. It can be integrated with an increasing number of issuers such as Let's Encrypt, Venafi, Google, Vault, etc. In order to configure Cert-manager with Let's Encrypt we'll create a ClusterIssuer. ℹ️ In the context of cert-manager, an Issuer is a Kubernetes resource that generates and manages certificates within a specific namespace, while a ClusterIssuer is a global resource that operates at the cluster level and can manage certificates across all namespaces.\nsecurity/base/cert-manager/le-clusterissuer-prod.yaml\n1apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 2kind: ClusterIssuer 3metadata: 4 name: letsencrypt-prod 5spec: 6 acme: 7 email: mymail@domain.tld 8 server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory 9 privateKeySecretRef: 10 name: ogenki-issuer-account-key 11 solvers: 12 - selector: 13 dnsZones: 14 - \u0026#34;cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 15 dns01: 16 route53: 17 region: eu-west-3 We are using the production instance of Let's Encrypt here, which is subject to certain rules, and it is recommended to start your tests on the staging instance. The email address is used to receive notifications, such as the need for renewal. An ogenki-issuer-account-key key is generated and used to authenticate with the ACME server. The mechanism that proves the legitimacy of a certificate request is done through DNS resolution. Now, how can we call this ClusterIssuer from a Gateway-API resource? It turns out there is a very simple integration through the use of an annotation at the Gateway level. This solution is experimental and requires a specific parameter during the deployment of cert-manager.\nsecurity/base/cert-manager/helmrelease.yaml\n1apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta2 2kind: HelmRelease 3metadata: 4 name: cert-manager 5 namespace: security 6spec: 7 values: 8... 9 featureGates: ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport=true It's also necessary to grant permissions to the Cert-manager controller to interact with Route53 to complete the DNS challenge. Here, I'm using a Crossplane Composition. (ℹ️ If you want to delve into Crossplane, it's over here.)\nThen, the annotation and the target secret need to be specified in the Gateway manifest.\ninfrastructure/base/gapi/platform-public-gateway.yaml\n1apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: Gateway 3metadata: 4 name: platform-public 5 annotations: 6 cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod 7spec: 8 gatewayClassName: cilium 9 listeners: 10 - name: http 11 hostname: \u0026#34;*.${domain_name}\u0026#34; 12... 13 tls: 14 mode: Terminate 15 certificateRefs: 16 - name: platform-public-tls When the Gateway is created, a certificate is generated.

This is a _secret of type tls which contains these files: tls.crt, tls.key, and ca.crt.\nThe view-cert plugin The certificates generated by cert-manager are stored in Kubernetes secrets. Although it is possible to extract them using base64 and openssl commands, why not make life easier? I am a command line guy and I regularly use the view-cert plugin, which displays a summary of tls type secrets.\n1kubectl view-cert -n infrastructure platform-public-tls 2[ 3 { 4 \u0026#34;SecretName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;platform-public-tls\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;Namespace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;infrastructure\u0026#34;, 6 \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: 3, 7 \u0026#34;SerialNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;35f659ad03e437805fbf48111b74738efe3\u0026#34;, 8 \u0026#34;Issuer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CN=R3,O=Let\u0026#39;s Encrypt,C=US\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;Validity\u0026#34;: { 10 \u0026#34;NotBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-01-28T09:41:35Z\u0026#34;, 11 \u0026#34;NotAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-04-27T09:41:34Z\u0026#34; 12 }, 13 \u0026#34;Subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CN=*.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34;, 14 \u0026#34;IsCA\u0026#34;: false 15 } 16] It can be installed using krew\n1kubectl krew install view-cert 🏠 A Private Certificate Creating private certificates using Vault is pretty similar to the above method, with slights differences. We also need to define a ClusterIssuer:\nsecurity/base/cert-manager/vault-clusterissuer.yaml\n1apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 2kind: ClusterIssuer 3metadata: 4 name: vault 5 namespace: security 6spec: 7 vault: 8 server: https://vault.priv.cloud.ogenki.io:8200 9 path: pki_private_issuer/sign/ogenki 10 caBundle: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0... 11 auth: 12 appRole: 13 path: approle 14 roleId: f8363d0f-b7db-9b08-67ab-8425ab527587 15 secretRef: 16 name: cert-manager-vault-approle 17 key: secretId The URL specified is that of the Vault server. It must be accessible from the pods within Kubernetes. The path in Vault is part of the Vault configuration phase. It refers to the role authorized to generate certificates. Here, we are using authentication via an Approle. For more details on all the actions necessary for configuring Cert-Manager with Vault, refer to this procedure.\nThe main difference with the method used for Let's Encrypt lies in the fact that the certificate must be explicitly created. Indeed, the previous method allowed for automatic creation with an annotation.\ninfrastructure/base/gapi/platform-private-gateway-certificate.yaml\n1apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 2kind: Certificate 3metadata: 4 name: private-gateway-certificate 5spec: 6 secretName: private-gateway-tls 7 duration: 2160h # 90d 8 renewBefore: 360h # 15d 9 commonName: private-gateway.priv.cloud.ogenki.io 10 dnsNames: 11 - gitops-${cluster_name}.priv.${domain_name} 12 - grafana-${cluster_name}.priv.${domain_name} 13 - harbor.priv.${domain_name} 14 issuerRef: 15 name: vault 16 kind: ClusterIssuer 17 group: cert-manager.io As we can see, this certificate is used to serve certificates for weave-gitops, grafana, and harbor applications.

Thanks to the automation built with Cert-manager, operational tasks are minimized while enhancing the security level.\nThe setup process for Let's Encrypt and the Gateway API is incredibly straightforward! Furthermore, the level of security that Vault offers for internal communications is certainly worth taking into account. However, it's clear that implementing multiple components requires meticulous attention during the setup of this entire infrastructure to ensure optimal security is maintained.\nConsiderations for Production It's important to recall some recommendations and best practices before considering a production deployment. To keep this article readable, some points have not been addressed, but it is crucial to include them in your strategy:\nKeep the root certificate offline. In other words, it's imperative to store it on a non-connected medium to protect it from any potential threats. The revocation of the root or intermediate CA wasn't discussed. As well as the provision of a revocation list (Certificate Revocation List). Access to the Vault API must be rigorously restricted to a private network. You should take a look at my article on Tailscale. Also note that I didn't talk about authentication at all, but it's essential to set up an identity provider from the start and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security. Moreover, it's advisable to revoke Vault's root token once adequate authentication and permissions are in place. If necessary, the token can be regenerated following the procedure available here. The default Opentofu AMI value for the AMI (AWS Instance Image) deploys an Ubuntu from Canonical. It's recommended to use one that has been hardened. I built mine using this project. To be able to initialize Vault, a command must be run on the instance, which justifies the use of SSM. However, it's advisable to disable it when the initialization phase is over (enable_ssm: false in the Opentofu variables). Send audit logs to a SIEM to be able to detect suspicious behaviors. Alert before the certificates expire. For example, you can use this exporter Prometheus open-sourced by the folks at Enix 😉. This is an additional safety measure, knowing that the proposed architecture makes everything automated. Pay special attention to KMS keys: the one used to unseal Vault, but also the one that allows creating snapshots. They are vital for restoring your backups. \u0026quot;A backup that's not verified is worthless\u0026quot;: Therefore, construct a workflow that will verify the consistency of data in Vault. This might be the subject of another article, stay tuned! Organize periodic disaster recovery (DR) exercises to ensure your ability to rebuild the entire system from scratch, making sure you have all the necessary documentation and tools. 🔖 References Github Issues\nCert-manager and Vault: \u0026quot;The CA full chain is not included into the ca.crt\u0026quot; Blog posts\nPrivate vs Public PKI: Building an Effective Plan (Author: Nick Naziridis) PKI Best practices for 2023 Build an Internal PKI with Vault (Author: Stéphane Este-Gracias) Hashicorp Documentation\nRegarding the integrated Raft storage: Reference Architecture Deployment Guide AWS Production hardening PKI ","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/pki-gapi/","section":"post","tags":["security"],"title":"`TLS` with Gateway API: Efficient and Secure Management of Public and Private Certificates"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/security/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Security"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/gitops/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Gitops"},{"body":" Update 2024-11-23 I'm now using the KCL (Kusion Configuration Language) for crossplane compositions.\nWith the emergence of Platform Engineering, we are witnessing a shift towards the creation of self-service solutions for developers. This approach facilitates the standardization of DevOps practices, enhances the developer experience, and reduces the cognitive load associated with managing tools.\nCrossplane, an \u0026quot;Incubating\u0026quot; project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), aims to become the leading framework for creating Cloud Native platforms. In my first article about Crossplane, I introduced this tool and explained how it leverages GitOPs principles for infrastructure, enabling the creation of a GKE cluster.\nNow celebrating its 5th anniversary 🎂🎉, the project has matured and expanded its features over time.\nIn this post, we will explore some of Crossplane's key features, with a particular focus on the Composition Functions that are generating significant interest within the community. Are we about to witness a pivotal moment for the project?\n🎯 Our target The Crossplane documentation is comprehensive, so we'll quickly review the basic concepts to focus on a specific use case: Deploying Harbor on an EKS cluster, adhering to high availability best practices.\nHarbor Harbor, also from the CNCF, is a security-focused container artifact management solution.\nIts primary role is to store, sign, and scan for vulnerabilities container images. Harbor features fine-grained access control, an API, and a web interface, allowing dev teams to access and manage their own images easily.\nHarbor's availability mainly depends on its stateful components. Users are responsible for their implementation, which should be tailored to the target infrastructure. This blog post presents the options I selected for optimal availability.\nRedis deployed using the Bitnami Helm chart in \u0026quot;master/slave\u0026quot; mode. Artifacts are stored in an AWS S3 bucket. A PostgreSQL RDS instance for the database. We will now explore how Crossplane simplifies the provisioning of this RDS instance by providing a level of abstraction that exposes only an opinionated set of options. 🚀\n🏗️ Prerequisites Before we can build our Compositions, some groundwork is necessary as several preliminary operations need to be carried out. These steps are performed in a specific order:\nDeployment of Crossplane's core controller using the Helm chart. Installation of the providers and their configurations. Deployment of various configurations using the previously installed providers, especially the Compositions and Composition Functions. Declarations of Claims to consume the Compositions. These steps are described through Flux's dependencies and can be viewed here.\nSources All the actions carried out in this article come from this git repository.\nThere you can find numerous sources that help me construct my blog posts. 🎄 🎁 Feedback is a gift 🙏\n📦 The Compositions Put simply, a Composition in Crossplane is a way to aggregate and automatically manage multiple resources whose configuration can sometimes be complex.\nIt leverages the Kubernetes API to define and orchestrate not just infrastructure elements like storage and networking, but also various other components (refer to the list of providers). This method provides developers with a simplified interface, representing an abstraction layer that hides the more complex technical details of the underlying infrastructure.\nTo achieve my goal of creating Harbor's database, I first looked for a relevant example. For this purpose, I used the Upbound marketplace, where a few Compositions can be found that can be used as starting points.\nBased on the configuration-rds composition, I wanted to add the following elements:\n🔑 Allow pods to access the instance. ▶️ Creation of a ExternalName Kubernetes service with a predictable name that will be used in Harbor's configuration. 💾 Creation of databases and the roles that will own them. ❓ How would this Composition then be used if, for example, a developer wishes to have a database? They is simply done by declaring a Claim which represents the level of abstraction exposed to the users.

These configuration elements are loaded into memory and can then be used within the composition.\nSince the EKS cluster is created with Opentofu, we store its properties using Flux variables. (more info on Flux's variables substitution here)\ninfrastructure/base/crossplane/configuration/environmentconfig.yaml\n1apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1alpha1 2kind: EnvironmentConfig 3metadata: 4 name: eks-environment 5data: 6 clusterName: ${cluster_name} 7 oidcUrl: ${oidc_issuer_url} 8 oidcHost: ${oidc_issuer_host} 9 oidcArn: ${oidc_provider_arn} 10 accountId: ${aws_account_id} 11 region: ${region} 12 vpcId: ${vpc_id} 13 CIDRBlock: ${vpc_cidr_block} 14 privateSubnetIds: ${private_subnet_ids} These variables can then be used in Compositions via the FromEnvironmentFieldPath directive. For instance, to allow pods to access our RDS instance, we allow the VPC's CIDR as follows:\ninfrastructure/base/crossplane/configuration/irsa-composition.yaml\n1- name: SecurityGroupIngressRule 2 base: 3 apiVersion: ec2.aws.upbound.io/v1beta1 4 kind: SecurityGroupIngressRule 5 spec: 6 forProvider: 7 cidrIpv4: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; 8 patches: 9... 10 - fromFieldPath: CIDRBlock 11 toFieldPath: spec.forProvider.cidrIpv4 12 type: FromEnvironmentFieldPath ⚠️ As of the time of writing this post, the feature is still in alpha.\n🛠️ Composition Functions Composition Functions represent a significant evolution in the development of Compositions. The traditional way of doing patch and transforms within a composition had certain limitations, such as the inability to use conditions, loops in the code, or to execute advanced functions (e.g., subnet calculations, checking the status of external resources).\nComposition Functions overcome these limitations and are essentially programs that extend the templating capabilities of resources within Crossplane. They can be written in any programming language, thus offering huge flexibility and power in defining compositions. This allows for complex tasks such as conditional transformations, iterations, and dynamic operations.\nThese functions are executed in a sequential manner (in Pipeline mode), with each function manipulating and transforming the resources and then passing the result to the next function, opening the door to powerful combinations.\nBut let's get back to our RDS composition 🔍! It indeed uses this new way of defining Compositions and consists of three steps:\ninfrastructure/base/crossplane/configuration/sql-instance-composition.yaml\n1apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1 2kind: Composition 3metadata: 4 name: xsqlinstances.cloud.ogenki.io 5... 6spec: 7 mode: Pipeline 8... 9 pipeline: 10 - step: patch-and-transform 11 functionRef: 12 name: function-patch-and-transform 13... 14 - step: sql-go-templating 15 functionRef: 16 name: function-go-templating 17... 18 - step: ready 19 functionRef: 20 name: function-auto-ready The syntax of the first step, patch-and-transform, might look familiar 😉. It is indeed the traditional patching method of Crossplane, but this time executed as a function in the Pipeline. The second step involves calling the function-go-templating function, which we will discuss in more detail shortly. Finally, the last step uses the function-auto-ready function, which checks whether the composite resource (XR) is ready. This means that all the resources composing it have reached the Ready state. Migration If you already have Compositions in the previous format (Patch \u0026amp; Transforms), there is a great tool available for migrating to the Pipeline mode: crossplane-migrator\nInstall crossplane-migrator 1go install github.com/crossplane-contrib/crossplane-migrator@latest Then execute the following command, which will generate the correct format in composition-pipeline.yaml 1crossplane-migrator new-pipeline-composition --function-name crossplane-contrib-function-patch-and-transform -i composition.yaml -o composition-pipeline.yaml ℹ️ This capabilitiy should be added to the Crossplane CLI in the next release (v1.15)\n🐹 Go templating in Compositions As mentioned earlier, the power of Composition Functions lies primarily in the fact that any programming language can be used. For instance, it's possible to generate resources from Go templates with the function-go-templating. Creating Composition with it is not so different from writing Helm Charts.\nAll you need to do is call the function and provide it with a template as input to generate Kubernetes resources. In the SQLInstance composition, the YAMLs are generated directly inline, but it's also possible to load local files (source: Filesystem).\n1 - step: sql-go-templating 2 functionRef: 3 name: function-go-templating 4 input: 5 apiVersion: gotemplating.fn.crossplane.io/v1beta1 6 kind: GoTemplate 7 source: Inline 8 inline: 9 template: | 10 ... Then it's your turn to play! For example, there is slight difference in generating a MariaDB or PostgreSQL database, so we can formulate conditions as follows:\n1{{- $apiVersion := \u0026#34;\u0026#34; }} 2{{- if eq $parameters.engine \u0026#34;postgres\u0026#34; }} 3 {{- $apiVersion = \u0026#34;postgresql.sql.crossplane.io/v1alpha1\u0026#34; }} 4{{- else }} 5 {{- $apiVersion = \u0026#34;mysql.sql.crossplane.io/v1alpha1\u0026#34; }} 6{{- end -}} This also allowed me to define a list of databases along with their owner.\n1apiVersion: cloud.ogenki.io/v1alpha1 2kind: SQLInstance 3metadata: 4... 5spec: 6 parameters: 7... 8 databases: 9 - owner: owner1 10 name: db1 11 - owner: owner2 12 name: db2 Then, I used Golang loops to create them using the SQL provider.\n1{{- range $parameters.databases }} 2--- 3apiVersion: {{ $apiVersion }} 4kind: Database 5metadata: 6 name: {{ .name | replace \u0026#34;_\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; }} 7 annotations: 8 {{ setResourceNameAnnotation (print \u0026#34;db-\u0026#34; (replace \u0026#34;_\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; .name)) }} 9spec: 10... 11{{- end }} It is even possible to develop more complex logic in go template functions using the usual define and include directives. Here is an excerpt from the examples available in the function's repository.\n1{{- define \u0026#34;labels\u0026#34; -}} 2some-text: {{.val1}} 3other-text: {{.val2}} 4{{- end }} 5... 6labels: 7 {{- include \u0026#34;labels\u0026#34; $vals | nindent 4}} 8... Finally, we can test the Composition and display the rendering of the template with the following command:\n1crank beta render tooling/base/harbor/sqlinstance.yaml infrastructure/base/crossplane/configuration/sql-instance-composition.yaml infrastructure/base/crossplane/configuration/function-go-templating.yaml As we can see, the possibilities are greatly expanded thanks to the ability to construct resources using a programming language. However, it is also necessary to ensure that the composition remains readable and maintainable in the long term. We will likely witness the emergence of best practices as we gain more experience with the use of these functions.\n💭 Final Thoughts When we talk about Infrastructure As Code, Terraform often comes to mind first. This tool, supported by a vast community, with a mature ecosystem, remains a top choice. However, it's interesting to ponder how Terraform has evolved in response to the new paradigms introduced by Kubernetes. We touched on this in our article on terraform controller. Since then, you may have noticed Hashicorp's controversial decision to adopt the Business Source License. This switch sparked many reactions and might have influenced the strategy and roadmap of other solutions...\nWithout saying that this is a direct reaction, recently, Crossplane updated its charter to expand its scope to the entire ecosystem (providers, functions), notably by integrating the Upjet project under the CNCF umbrella. The goal of this move is to strengthen the governance of associated projects and ultimately improve the developer experience.\nPersonally, I've been using Crossplane for a while for specific use cases. I even deployed it in production at a company, using a composition to define specific permissions for pods on EKS (IRSA). We also restricted the types of resources a developer could declare.\n❓ So, what to think of this new experience with Crossplane?\nIt is obvious that Composition Functions promise exciting horizons, and we can expect to see many functions emerge in 2024 🚀\nHowever, imho, it is crucial that development and operation tools continue to improve to foster adoption of the project. For instance, a web interface or a k9s plugin would be useful.\nFurthermore, for a beginner looking to develop a composition or a function, the first step might seem daunting. Validating a composition is not straightforward, and there aren't many examples to follow. We hope the marketplace will grow over time.\nThat said, these concerns are being addressed by the Crossplane community, especially by the SIG Dev XP, whose efforts deserve applause and who are currently doing significant work. 👏\nI encourage you to closely follow the project's evolution in the coming months 👀, and to try out Crossplane for yourself to form your own opinion.\n🔖 References Crossplane blog: Improve Crossplane Compositions Authoring with go-templating-function Dev XP Roadmap Video (Kubecon NA 2023): Crossplane Intro and Deep Dive - the Cloud Native Control Plane Framework Video (DevOps Toolkit): Crossplane Composition Functions: Unleashing the Full Potential ","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/crossplane_composition_functions/","section":"post","tags":["infrastructure","devxp","gitops"],"title":"Going Further with `Crossplane`: Compositions and Functions"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/infrastructure/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Infrastructure"},{"body":"When we talk about securing access to cloud resources, one of the golden rules is to avoid direct exposure to the Internet. This raises a question for Dev/Ops: How can we , for instance, access a database, a Kubernetes cluster, or a server via SSH without compromising security? Virtual Private Networks (VPN) offer an answer by establishing a secure link between different elements of a network, regardless of their geographical location. Solutions range from SaaS models to self-hosted platforms, using various protocols, either open-source or proprietary.\nAmong these options, I wanted to introduce you to Tailscale. This solution uses WireGuard under the hood, known for its simplicity and performance. With Tailscale, you can securely connect devices or servers as if they were on the same local network, even though they are spread across the globe.\n🎯 Our target Understanding how Tailscale works Implementing a secure connection with AWS in a few minutes Interacting with an EKS cluster API via a private network Accessing services hosted on Kubernetes using the private network. Throughout this article, you will obviously need to create a Tailscale account. It's worth noting that authentication is delegated to third-party identity providers (e.g., Okta, OneLogin, Google).\nOnce the account is created, you'll have instant access to the management console. It allows you to list connected devices, visualize logs, and change most of the settings.\n💡 Under the Hood Terminology Mesh VPN: A mesh VPN refers to a VPN network configuration in which every node (i.e., each device or machine) connects directly to every other node, creating a mesh-like structure. This stands in contrast to traditional VPN configurations that usually adopt a \u0026quot;hub and spoke\u0026quot; topology, where multiple clients connect to one central server.\nZero Trust: This approach operates on the principle that every access request to a network is inherently untrusted. Whether an application or user, identity must be proven and authorization given before accessing a resource. Trust isn't assumed based solely on originating from an internal network or a specific geographic location.\nTailnet: When you first use Tailscale, a Tailnet is automatically generated for you, representing your personal private network. Every device within this tailnet is assigned a unique Tailscale IP.\nTailscale's architecture clearly distinguishes between the Control plane and the Data plane:\nThe coordination server primarily manages the exchange of metadata and public keys among all Tailnet members. Importantly, by Tailscale's design, only the public key is shared, with the private key securely retained on its originating node.\nThe nodes in the Tailnet establish a mesh network: Instead of passing data through the coordination server, these nodes communicate directly in a peer-to-peer manner. Each node has a unique identity, allowing it to authenticate and become part of the Tailnet.\n\u0026#x1f4e5; Client Installation Most platforms are supported, and the installation options are listed here. As for me, I am on Archlinux:\n1sudo pacman -S tailscale It's possible to start the service automatically upon machine startup.\n1sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled To register your personal computer, run the following command:\n1sudo tailscale up --accept-routes 2 3To authenticate, visit: 4 5 https://login.tailscale.com/a/f50... ℹ️ The --accept-routes option is required on Linux in order to configure the routes announced by Subnet routers. We'll delve deeper into this later on in this post.\nEnsure that you've indeed acquired an IP from the Tailscale network:\n1tailscale ip -4 2100.118.83.67 3 4tailscale status 5100.118.83.67 ogenki smainklh@ linux - ℹ️ For Linux users, ensure that Tailscale works well with your DNS configuration: Follow this documentation.\nSources All the steps performed in this article come from this git repository.\nIt will allow you to create all the components aiming to set up an EKS Lab cluster, following a previous blog post on Cilium and Gateway API.\n☁️ Accessing AWS Privately To securely access all resources available on AWS, one can deploy a Subnet router.\nA Subnet router is a Tailscale instance that provides access to subnets not directly linked to Tailscale. It acts as a bridge between Tailscale's virtual private network (Tailnet) and other local networks.\nWe can then reach Cloud subnets through Tailscale's VPN.\n⚠️ To do so, on AWS, you'll need to configure the security groups appropriately to allow Subnet routers.\n🚀 Deploying a Subnet Router Let's dive in and deploy a Subnet router on an AWS network! Everything is done using the Terraform code present in the directory opentofu/network. We will analyze the Tailscale-specific configuration present in the tailscale.tf file before deploying.\nThe Terraform provider You can configure several settings via the API Tailscale using the Terraform provider. First, you need to generate an API key 🔑 from the admin console:\nYou should keep this key in a secure store as it is used to deploy the Subnet router.\n1provider \u0026#34;tailscale\u0026#34; { 2 api_key = var.tailscale.api_key 3 tailnet = var.tailscale.tailnet 4} The ACL's\nAccess Control Lists allow you to define who is authorized to communicate with whom (user or device). Upon account creation, they are very permissive, and there are no restrictions (everyone can communicate with everyone).\n1resource \u0026#34;tailscale_acl\u0026#34; \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; { 2 acl = jsonencode({ 3 acls = [ 4 { 5 action = \u0026#34;accept\u0026#34; 6 src = [\u0026#34;*\u0026#34;] 7 dst = [\u0026#34;*:*\u0026#34;] 8 } 9 ] 10... 11} Note For my Lab environment, I kept this default configuration because I'm the only person accessing it. Furthermore, the only devices connected to my Tailnet are my laptop and the Subnet router. However, in a corporate setting, you need to think this through. It's then possible to define a security policy based on groups of people or node tags.\nCheck out this doc for more info.\nDomain Names\nThere are various ways to manage DNS with Tailscale:\nMagic DNS: When a device joins the Tailnet, it registers with a name, and this can be immediately used to communicate with the device.\n1tailscale status 2100.118.83.67 ogenki smainklh@ linux - 3100.115.31.152 ip-10-0-43-98 smainklh@ linux active; relay \u0026#34;par\u0026#34;, tx 3044 rx 2588 4 5ping ip-10-0-43-98 6PING ip-10-0-43-98.tail9c382.ts.net (100.115.31.152) 56(84) bytes of data. 764 bytes from ip-10-0-43-98.tail9c382.ts.net (100.115.31.152): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=11.4 ms AWS: To use AWS internal domain names, you can utilize the second IP of the VPC, which always corresponds to the DNS server (In our case it would be 10.0.0.2). This enables the use of potential private zones on route53 or connection to resources using domain names.\nThe simplest configuration is thus to declare the list of DNS servers to use and add the AWS one. Here's an example with Cloudflare's public DNS.\n1resource \u0026#34;tailscale_dns_nameservers\u0026#34; \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; { 2 nameservers = [ 3 \u0026#34;1.1.1.1\u0026#34;, 4 cidrhost(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 2) 5 ] 6} The Authentication Key\nFor a device to join the Tailnet at startup, Tailscale must be started using an authentication key. It is generated as follows:\n1resource \u0026#34;tailscale_tailnet_key\u0026#34; \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; { 2 reusable = true 3 ephemeral = false 4 preauthorized = true 5} reusable: As we're using an autoscaling group which can be composed of multiple instances, this key should be reusable multiple times. ephemeral: For this demo, we have created a non-expiring key. In a production environment, enabling expiration would be preferable. preauthorized: This key needs to be valid and preauthorized so that the instance can automatically join Tailscale. The generated key is then used to launch tailscale with the --auth-key parameter.\n1sudo tailscale up --authkey=\u0026lt;REDACTED\u0026gt; Announcing Routes for AWS subnets\nIt's also necessary to announce the network that we wish to route through the Subnet router. In our example, we choose to route the entire VPC network with the CIDR 10.0.0.0/16.\nTo automate this process, an autoApprovers rule needs to be added. This indicates that the routes announced by the user smainklh@gmail.com are authorized without requiring an approval step.\n1 autoApprovers = { 2 routes = { 3 \u0026#34;10.0.0.0/16\u0026#34; = [\u0026#34;smainklh@gmail.com\u0026#34;] 4 } 5 } Here is the Taiscale command run in the Subnet router:\n1sudo tailscale up --authkey=\u0026lt;REDACTED\u0026gt; --advertise-routes=\u0026#34;10.0.0.0/16\u0026#34; The Terraform Module I've created a module that is straightforward and allows deploying an autoscaling group on AWS and configuring Tailscale. Upon the instance's startup, it will authenticate using an auth_key and announce the specified networks. In the example below, the instance announces the CIDR of the VPC on AWS.\n1module \u0026#34;tailscale_subnet_router\u0026#34; { 2 source = \u0026#34;Smana/tailscale-subnet-router/aws\u0026#34; 3 version = \u0026#34;1.0.4\u0026#34; 4 5 region = var.region 6 env = var.env 7 8 name = var.tailscale.subnet_router_name 9 auth_key = tailscale_tailnet_key.this.key 10 11 vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id 12 subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets 13 advertise_routes = [module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block] 14... 15} Now that we've examined the various parameters, it's time to start our Subnet router 🚀 !! First, you need to create a variable.tfvars file in the opentofu/network directory.\n1env = \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34; 2region = \u0026#34;eu-west-3\u0026#34; 3private_domain_name = \u0026#34;priv.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 4 5tailscale = { 6 subnet_router_name = \u0026#34;ogenki\u0026#34; 7 tailnet = \u0026#34;smainklh@gmail.com\u0026#34; 8 api_key = \u0026#34;tskey-api-...\u0026#34; 9} 10 11tags = { 12 project = \u0026#34;demo-cloud-native-ref\u0026#34; 13 owner = \u0026#34;Smana\u0026#34; 14} Then run the following command:\n1tofu plan --var-file variables.tfvars After checking the plan, apply the changes as follows\n1tofu apply --var-file variables.tfvars When the instance starts up, it will appear in the list of devices on the Tailnet.\n1tailscale status 2100.118.83.67 ogenki smainklh@ linux - 3100.68.109.138 ip-10-0-26-99 smainklh@ linux active; relay \u0026#34;par\u0026#34;, tx 33868 rx 32292 We can also check that the route is correctly announced as follows:\n1tailscale status --json|jq \u0026#39;.Peer[] | select(.HostName == \u0026#34;ip-10-0-26-99\u0026#34;) .PrimaryRoutes\u0026#39; 2[ 3 \u0026#34;10.0.0.0/16\u0026#34; 4] ⚠️ For security reasons, do not forget to delete the variables.tfvars file as it contains the API key.\n👏 That's it! We are now able to access the network on AWS, provided we've also set up the filtering rules, such as ACLs and security groups. For instance, we can access a database from the workstation.\n1psql -h demo-tailscale.cymnaynfchjt.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres 2Password for user postgres: 3psql (15.4, server 15.3) 4SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, compression: off) 5Type \u0026#34;help\u0026#34; for help. 6 7postgres=\u0026gt; 💻 A Different Way to SSH Traditionally, we often connect to servers using the SSH protocol. This involves generating a private key and distributing the corresponding public key to remote servers.\nUnlike traditional SSH key usage, Tailscale uses Wireguard for authentication and encrypted connections, eliminating the need to re-authenticate the client. Furthermore, Tailscale handles the distribution of SSH host keys. Through ACL rules, user access can be revoked without the need to delete SSH keys. There's also a mode that can be activated to enhance security by requiring periodic re-authentication. It's evident that Tailscale SSH simplifies authentication, streamlines SSH connection management, and enhance security levels.\nTo achieve this, one must also initiate Tailscale with the --ssh option. Permissions for SSH are managed at the ACL level as follows:\n1... 2 ssh = [ 3 { 4 action = \u0026#34;check\u0026#34; 5 src = [\u0026#34;autogroup:member\u0026#34;] 6 dst = [\u0026#34;autogroup:self\u0026#34;] 7 users = [\u0026#34;autogroup:nonroot\u0026#34;] 8 } 9 ] 10... The rule mentioned above allows all users to access their own devices via SSH. When trying to connect, they must use a user account other than root. Each connection attempt mandates an additional authentication (action=check). This authentication is carried out by visiting a specific web link.\n1ssh ubuntu@ip-10-0-26-99 2... 3# Tailscale SSH requires an additional check. 4# To authenticate, visit: https://login.tailscale.com/a/f1f09a548cc6 5... 6ubuntu@ip-10-0-26-99:~$ Access logs to the machine can be viewed using journalctl.\n1ubuntu@ip-10-0-26-99:~$ journalctl -aeu tailscaled|grep ssh 2Oct 15 15:51:34 ip-10-0-26-99 tailscaled[1768]: ssh-conn-20231015T155130-00ede660b8: handling conn: 100.118.83.67:55098-\u0026gt;ubuntu@100.68.109.138:22 3Oct 15 15:51:56 ip-10-0-26-99 tailscaled[1768]: ssh-conn-20231015T155156-b6d1dc28c0: handling conn: 100.118.83.67:44560-\u0026gt;ubuntu@100.68.109.138:22 4Oct 15 15:52:52 ip-10-0-26-99 tailscaled[1768]: ssh-conn-20231015T155156-b6d1dc28c0: starting session: sess-20231015T155252-5b2acc170e 5Oct 15 15:52:52 ip-10-0-26-99 tailscaled[1768]: ssh-session(sess-20231015T155252-5b2acc170e): handling new SSH connection from smainklh@gmail.com (100.118.83.67) to ssh-user \u0026#34;ubuntu\u0026#34; 6Oct 15 15:52:52 ip-10-0-26-99 tailscaled[1768]: ssh-session(sess-20231015T155252-5b2acc170e): access granted to smainklh@gmail.com as ssh-user \u0026#34;ubuntu\u0026#34; 7Oct 15 15:52:52 ip-10-0-26-99 tailscaled[1768]: ssh-session(sess-20231015T155252-5b2acc170e): starting pty command: [/usr/sbin/tailscaled be-child ssh --uid=1000 --gid=1000 --groups=1000,4,20,24,25,27,29,30,44,46,115,116 --local-user=ubuntu --remote-user=smainklh@gmail.com --remote-ip=100.118.83.67 --has-tty=true --tty-name=pts/0 --shell --login-cmd=/usr/bin/login --cmd=/bin/bash -- -l] ℹ️ With Tailscale SSH, you can SSH into a device no matter where it's located. However, in a 100% AWS context, one would likely prefer using AWS SSM.\nLogs 💾 In security, retaining logs for future reference is vital. There are various types of logs:\nAudit Logs: These provide insights into who did what. They can be accessed through the admin console and can also be forwarded to a SIEM.\nDevice Logs: Specific commands to each device can be used to view these, such as (journalctl -u tailscaled on Linux).\nNetwork Logs: These are useful for visualizing the connections between devices.\n☸ What About Kubernetes? In the context of Kubernetes, there are several options for accessing a Service:\nProxy: This method involves an additional pod that forwards calls to an existing Service. Sidecar: This allows a pod to connect to the Tailnet. As a result, end-to-end connectivity is established, making bi-directional communication possible (from the pod to the Tailnet nodes). Operator: This approach facilitates exposing Kubernetes services and the API (ingress) and permits pods to access Tailnet nodes (egress). Configuration is achieved by modifying existing resources: Services and Ingresses. In our setup, we already have a Subnet router that routes the entire VPC network. As such, it's sufficient for our service to be exposed via a private IP.\nThe Kubernetes API To access the Kubernetes API, it's essential to authorize the Subnet router. This is accomplished by setting the following rule for the source security group.\nopentofu/eks/main.tf\n1module \u0026#34;eks\u0026#34; { 2... 3 cluster_security_group_additional_rules = { 4 ingress_source_security_group_id = { 5 description = \u0026#34;Ingress from the Tailscale security group to the API server\u0026#34; 6 protocol = \u0026#34;tcp\u0026#34; 7 from_port = 443 8 to_port = 443 9 type = \u0026#34;ingress\u0026#34; 10 source_security_group_id = data.aws_security_group.tailscale.id 11 } 12 } 13... 14} Let's ensure that the API is indeed accessible on a private IP.\n1CLUSTER_URL=$(TERM=dumb kubectl cluster-info | grep \u0026#34;Kubernetes control plane\u0026#34; | awk \u0026#39;{print $NF}\u0026#39;) 2 3curl -s -o /dev/null -w \u0026#39;%{remote_ip}\\n\u0026#39; ${CLUSTER_URL} 410.228.244.167 5 6kubectl get ns 7NAME STATUS AGE 8cilium-secrets Active 5m46s 9crossplane-system Active 4m1s 10default Active 23m 11flux-system Active 5m29s 12infrastructure Active 4m1s 13... Accessing Kubernetes Services Privately An exposed Kubernetes Service is just another AWS network resource 😉. We simply need to ensure that this service uses a private IP. In my example, I'm using the Gateway API to configure Clouder's load balancing, and I encourage you to read my previous article on the subject.\nAll that's needed is to create an internal NLB, ensuring that the Service has the annotation service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme set to internal. With Cilium Gateway API, this is achieved via the Kyverno clusterPolicy.\n1 metadata: 2 annotations: 3 external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: gitops-${cluster_name}.priv.${domain_name},grafana-${cluster_name}.priv.${domain_name} 4 service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: \u0026#34;internal\u0026#34; 5 service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: tcp 6 spec: 7 loadBalancerClass: service.k8s.aws/nlb However, there's an additional prerequisite since we can't use Let's Encrypt for private DNS zones. I've thus generated an internal PKI that produces self-signed certificates with Cert-manager.\nIn this post, I won't delve into the details of the EKS cluster deployment or the configuration of Flux. Once the cluster is created and all the Kubernetes resources have been reconciled, we have a service that is exposed via an internal AWS LoadBalancer.\n1NLB_DOMAIN=$(kubectl get svc -n infrastructure cilium-gateway-platform -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}) 2dig +short ${NLB_DOMAIN} 310.0.33.5 410.0.26.228 510.0.9.183 An DNS record is also automatically created for the exposed services, allowing us to access privately through the Flux web interface.\n1dig +short gitops-mycluster-0.priv.cloud.ogenki.io 210.0.9.183 310.0.26.228 410.0.33.5 💭 Final Thoughts Some time ago, in a professional context, I implemented Cloudflare Zero Trust. I've noticed here that Tailscale shares many similarities with this solution. Of course, there are other solutions like Teleport, and the choice of a solution for private access to one's infrastructure depends on the context and security goals.\nFor me, I was particularly convinced by the simplicity of Tailscale's implementation, perfectly meeting my need to access the Clouder network.\nPart of Tailscale's code is open source, especially the client which is under the BSD 3-Clause license. The proprietary part mainly concerns the coordination platform. It's worth noting that there's an open-source alternative named Headscale. This is a distinct initiative with no connection to the Tailscale company.\nFor personal use, Tailscale is quite generous, offering free access for up to 100 devices and 3 users. That said, Tailscale is a serious option to consider for businesses, and in my opinion, it's essential to support companies that have a clear open-source policy and a quality product.\n","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/tailscale/","section":"post","tags":["security","network"],"title":"Beyond Traditional VPNs: Simplifying Cloud Access with `Tailscale`"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/network/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Network"},{"body":"When deploying an application on Kubernetes, the next step usually involves making it accessible to users. We commonly use Ingress controllers, such as Nginx, Haproxy, Traefik, or those from Cloud providers, to direct incoming traffic to the application, manage load balancing, TLS termination, and more.\nThen we have to choose from the plethora of available options 🤯. Cilium is, relatively recently, one of them and aims to handle all these networking aspects.\nCilium is an Open-Source networking and security solution based on eBPF whose adoption is growing rapidly. It's probably the network plugin that provides the most features. We won't cover all of them, but one such feature involves managing incoming traffic using the Gateway API (GAPI).\n🎯 Our target Understand exactly what the Gateway API is and how it represents an evolution from the Ingress API. Demonstrations of real-world scenarios deployed the GitOps way. Current limitations and upcoming developments. Tip All the steps carried out in this article come from this git repository.\nI encourage you to explore it, as it goes far beyond the context of this article:\nInstallation of an EKS cluster with Cilium configured with the kube-proxy replacement enbled and a dedicated Daemonset for Envoy. Proposal of a Flux structure with dependency management and a DRY code I think is efficient. Crossplane and IRSA composition which simplifies the management of IAM permissions for platform components. Automated domain names and certificates management with External-DNS and Let's Encrypt. The idea being to have everything set up in just a few minutes, with a single command line 🤩.\n☸ Introduction to Gateway API As mentioned previously, there are many Ingress Controllers options, and each has its own specificities and particular features, sometimes making their use complex. Furthermore, the traditionnal Ingress API in Kubernetes has very limited parameters. Some solutions have even created their own CRDs (Kubernetes Custom Resources) while others use annotations to overcome these limitations.\nHere comes the Gateway API! This is actually a standard that allows declaring advanced networking features without requiring specific extensions to the underlying controller. Moreover, since all controllers use the same API, it is possible to switch from one solution to another without changing the configuration (The Kubenetes manifests which describe how the incoming traffic should be routed).\nAmong the concepts that we will explore, GAPI brings a granular authorization model which defines explicit roles with distinct permissions. (More information on the GAPI security model here).\nThis is worth noting that this project is driven by the sig-network-kubernetes working group, and there's a slack channel where you can reach out to them if needed.\nLet's see how GAPI is used in practice with Cilium 🚀!\n\u0026#x2611;\u0026#xfe0f; Prerequisites For the remainder of this article, we assume an EKS cluster has been deployed. If you're not using the method suggested in the demo repo as the basis for this article, there are a few points to check for GAPI to be usable.\nℹ️ The installation method described here is based on Helm, all the values can be viewed here.\nInstall the CRDs available in the Gateway API repository. Note If Cilium is set up with GAPI support (see below) and the CRDs are missing, it won't start. In the demo repo, the GAPI CRDs are installed once during the cluster creation so that Cilium can start, and then they are managed by Flux.\nReplace kube-proxy with the network forwarding features provided by Cilium and eBPF.\n1kubeProxyReplacement: true Enable Gateway API support. 1gatewayAPI: 2 enabled: true Check the installation For that you need to install the command line tool cilium. I personnaly use asdf:\n1asdf plugin-add cilium-cli 2asdf install cilium-cli 0.15.7 3asdf global cilium 0.15.7 The following command allows to ensure that all the components are up and running:\n1cilium status --wait 2 /¯¯\\ 3/¯¯\\__/¯¯\\ Cilium: OK 4\\__/¯¯\\__/ Operator: OK 5/¯¯\\__/¯¯\\ Envoy DaemonSet: OK 6\\__/¯¯\\__/ Hubble Relay: disabled 7 \\__/ ClusterMesh: disabled 8 9Deployment cilium-operator Desired: 2, Ready: 2/2, Available: 2/2 10DaemonSet cilium Desired: 2, Ready: 2/2, Available: 2/2 11DaemonSet cilium-envoy Desired: 2, Ready: 2/2, Available: 2/2 12Containers: cilium Running: 2 13 cilium-operator Running: 2 14 cilium-envoy Running: 2 15Cluster Pods: 33/33 managed by Cilium 16Helm chart version: 1.14.2 17Image versions cilium quay.io/cilium/cilium:v1.14.2@sha256:6263f3a3d5d63b267b538298dbeb5ae87da3efacf09a2c620446c873ba807d35: 2 18 cilium-operator quay.io/cilium/operator-aws:v1.14.2@sha256:8d514a9eaa06b7a704d1ccead8c7e663334975e6584a815efe2b8c15244493f1: 2 19 cilium-envoy quay.io/cilium/cilium-envoy:v1.25.9-e198a2824d309024cb91fb6a984445e73033291d@sha256:52541e1726041b050c5d475b3c527ca4b8da487a0bbb0309f72247e8127af0ec: 2 Finally you can check that the Gateway API support is enabled by running\n1cilium config view | grep -w \u0026#34;enable-gateway-api\u0026#34; 2enable-gateway-api true 3enable-gateway-api-secrets-sync true You could also run end to end tests as follows\n1cilium connectivity test ⚠️ However this command (connectivity test) currently throws errors with Envoy as a DaemonSet enabled. (Github Issue).\nInfo as DaemonSet\nBy default, the Cilium agent also runs Envoy within the same pod and delegates to it level 7 network operations. Since the version v1.14, it is possible to deploy Envoy separately, which brings several benefits:\nIf one modifies/restarts a component (whether it's Cilium or Envoy), it doesn't affect the other. Better allocate resources to each component to optimize performance. Limits the attack surface in case of compromise of one of the pods. Envoy logs and Cilium agent logs are not mixed. You can use the following command to check that this feature is indeed active:\n1cilium status 2 /¯¯\\ 3 /¯¯\\__/¯¯\\ Cilium: OK 4 \\__/¯¯\\__/ Operator: OK 5 /¯¯\\__/¯¯\\ Envoy DaemonSet: OK 6 \\__/¯¯\\__/ Hubble Relay: disabled 7 \\__/ ClusterMesh: disabled More info.\n🚪 The Entry Point: GatewayClass and Gateway Once the conditions are met, we have access to several elements. We can make use of the custom resources defined by the Gateway API CRDs. Moreover, right after installing Cilium, a GatewayClass is immediately available.\n1kubectl get gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2NAME CONTROLLER ACCEPTED AGE 3cilium io.cilium/gateway-controller True 7m59s On a Kubernetes cluster, you could configure multiple GatewayClasses, thus having the ability to use different implementations. For instance, we can use Linkerd by referencing the GatewayClass in the Gateway configuration.\nThe Gateway is the resource that allows triggering the creation of load balancing components in the Cloud provider.\nHere's a simple example: apps/base/echo/gateway.yaml\n1apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: Gateway 3metadata: 4 name: echo-gateway 5 namespace: echo 6spec: 7 gatewayClassName: cilium 8 listeners: 9 - protocol: HTTP 10 port: 80 11 name: echo-1-echo-server 12 allowedRoutes: 13 namespaces: 14 from: Same On AWS (EKS), when configuring a Gateway, Cilium creates a Service of type LoadBalancer. Then another controller (The AWS Load Balancer Controller) handles the creation of the Cloud load balancer (NLB)\n1kubectl get svc -n echo cilium-gateway-echo 2NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE 3cilium-gateway-echo LoadBalancer 172.20.19.82 k8s-echo-ciliumga-64708ec85c-fcb7661f1ae4e4a4.elb.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com 80:30395/TCP 2m58s This is worth noting that the load balancer address is also linked to the Gateway.\n1kubectl get gateway -n echo echo 2NAME CLASS ADDRESS PROGRAMMED AGE 3echo cilium k8s-echo-ciliumga-64708ec85c-fcb7661f1ae4e4a4.elb.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com True 16m \u0026#x21aa;\u0026#xfe0f; Routing rules: HTTPRoute A basic rule To summarize the above diagram in a few words: An HTTPRoute allows configuring the routing to the service by referencing the Gateway and defining the desired routing parameters.\nNote workaround\nAs of now, it is not possible to configure the annotations of services generated by the Gateways (Github Issue). A workaround has been proposed to modify the service generated by the Gateway as soon as it is created.\nKyverno is a tool that ensures configuration compliance with best practices and security requirements. We are using it here solely for its ability to easily describe a mutation rule.\nsecurity/mycluster-0/echo-gw-clusterpolicy.yaml\n1spec: 2 rules: 3 - name: mutate-svc-annotations 4 match: 5 any: 6 - resources: 7 kinds: 8 - Service 9 namespaces: 10 - echo 11 name: cilium-gateway-echo 12 mutate: 13 patchStrategicMerge: 14 metadata: 15 annotations: 16 external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: echo.${domain_name} 17 service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: \u0026#34;internet-facing\u0026#34; 18 service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: tcp 19 spec: 20 loadBalancerClass: service.k8s.aws/nlb The service cilium-gateway-echo will therefore have the AWS controller's annotations added, as well as an annotation allowing for automatic DNS record configuration.\napps/base/echo/httproute.yaml\n1apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: HTTPRoute 3metadata: 4 name: echo-1 5 namespace: echo 6spec: 7 parentRefs: 8 - name: echo 9 namespace: echo 10 rules: 11 - matches: 12 - path: 13 type: PathPrefix 14 value: / 15 backendRefs: 16 - name: echo-1-echo-server 17 port: 80 The example used above is very simple: all requests are forwarded to the echo-1-echo-server service.\nparentRefs indicates which Gateway to use and then the routing rules are defined under the rules section.\nThe routing rules could also be based on the path.\n1... 2spec: 3 hostnames: 4 - foo.bar.com 5 rules: 6 - matches: 7 - path: 8 type: PathPrefix 9 value: /login Or based on an HTTP Header\n1... 2spec: 3 rules: 4 - matches: 5 headers: 6 - name: \u0026#34;version\u0026#34; 7 value: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; 8... Let's check if the service is reachable.:\n1curl -s http://echo.cloud.ogenki.io | jq -rc \u0026#39;.environment.HOSTNAME\u0026#39; 2echo-1-echo-server-fd88497d-w6sgn As you can see, the service is exposed in HTTP without a certificate. Let's try to fix that 😉\nConfigure a TLS certificate There are several methods to configure TLS with GAPI. Here, we will use the most common case: HTTPS protocol and TLS termination at the Gateway.\nLet's assume we want to configure the domain name echo.cloud.ogenki.io used earlier. The configuration is mainly done by configuring the Gateway.\napps/base/echo/tls-gateway.yaml\n1apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: Gateway 3metadata: 4 name: echo 5 namespace: echo 6 annotations: 7 cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod 8spec: 9 gatewayClassName: cilium 10 listeners: 11 - name: http 12 hostname: \u0026#34;echo.${domain_name}\u0026#34; 13 port: 443 14 protocol: HTTPS 15 allowedRoutes: 16 namespaces: 17 from: Same 18 tls: 19 mode: Terminate 20 certificateRefs: 21 - name: echo-tls The essential point here is the reference to a secret containing the certificate named echo-tls. This certificate can be created manually, but for this article, I chose to automate this with Let's Encrypt and cert-manager.\nInfo cert-manager\nWith cert-manager, it's pretty straightforward to automate the creation and update of certificates exposed by the Gateway. For this, you need to allow the controller to access route53 in order to solve a DNS01 challenge (A mechanism that ensures that clients can only request certificates for domains they own).\nA ClusterIssuer resource describes the required configuration to generate certificates with cert-manager.\nNext, we just need to add an annotation cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer and set the Kubernetes secret where the certificate will be stored.\nMore information\nℹ️ In the demo repo, permissions are assigned using Crossplane, which takes care of configuring these IAM perms in AWS.\nFor routing to work correctly, you also need to attach the HTTPRoute to the right Gateway and specify the domain name.\n1apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: HTTPRoute 3metadata: 4 name: echo-1 5 namespace: echo 6spec: 7 parentRefs: 8 - name: echo 9 namespace: echo 10 hostnames: 11 - \u0026#34;echo.${domain_name}\u0026#34; 12... After a few seconds the certificate will be created.\n1kubectl get cert -n echo 2NAME READY SECRET AGE 3echo-tls True echo-tls 43m Finally, we can check that the certificate indeed comes from Let's Encrypt as follows:\n1curl https://echo.cloud.ogenki.io -v 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | grep -A 6 \u0026#39;Server certificate\u0026#39; 2* Server certificate: 3* subject: CN=echo.cloud.ogenki.io 4* start date: Sep 15 14:43:00 2023 GMT 5* expire date: Dec 14 14:42:59 2023 GMT 6* subjectAltName: host \u0026#34;echo.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; matched cert\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;echo.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 7* issuer: C=US; O=Let\u0026#39;s Encrypt; CN=R3 8* SSL certificate verify ok. Info GAPI also allows you to configure end-to-end TLS, all the way to the container. This is done by configuring the Gateway in Passthrough mode and using a TLSRoute resource. The certificate must also be carried by the pod that performs the TLS termination.\nSharing a Gateway accross multiple namespaces With GAPI, you can route traffic across Namespaces. This is made possible thanks to distinct resources for each function: A Gateway that allows configuring the infrastructure, and the *Routes. These routes can be attached to a Gateway located in another namespace. It is thus possible for different teams/projects to share the same infrastructure components.\nHowever, this requires to specify which route is allowed to reference the Gateway. Here we assume that we have a Gateway dedicated to internal tools called platform. By using the allowedRoutes parameter, we explicitly specify which namespaces are allowed to be attached to this Gateway.\ninfrastructure/base/gapi/platform-gateway.yaml\n1... 2 allowedRoutes: 3 namespaces: 4 from: Selector 5 selector: 6 matchExpressions: 7 - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name 8 operator: In 9 values: 10 - observability 11 - flux-system 12 tls: 13 mode: Terminate 14 certificateRefs: 15 - name: platform-tls The HTTPRoutes configured in the namespaces observability and flux-system are attached to this unique Gateway.\n1... 2spec: 3 parentRefs: 4 - name: platform 5 namespace: infrastructure And therefore, use the same load balancer from the Cloud provider.\n1NLB_DOMAIN=$(kubectl get svc -n infrastructure cilium-gateway-platform -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}) 2 3dig +short ${NLB_DOMAIN} 413.36.89.108 5 6dig +short grafana-mycluster-0.cloud.ogenki.io 713.36.89.108 8 9dig +short gitops-mycluster-0.cloud.ogenki.io 1013.36.89.108 Note 🔒 These internal tools shouldn't be exposed on the Internet, but you know: this is just a demo 🙏. For instance, we could use an internal Gateway (private IP) by playing with the annotations and make use of a private connection system (VPN, tunnels...).\nTraffic splitting One feature that is commonly brought by Service Meshes is the ability to test an application on a portion of the traffic when a new version is available (A/B testing or Canary deployment). GAPI makes this quite simple by using weights.\nHere's an example that forwards 5% of the traffic to the service echo-2-echo-server:\napps/base/echo/httproute-split.yaml\n1... 2 hostnames: 3 - \u0026#34;split-echo.${domain_name}\u0026#34; 4 rules: 5 - matches: 6 - path: 7 type: PathPrefix 8 value: / 9 backendRefs: 10 - name: echo-1-echo-server 11 port: 80 12 weight: 95 13 - name: echo-2-echo-server 14 port: 80 15 weight: 5 Let's check that the distribution happens as expected:\nscripts/check-split.sh\n1./scripts/check-split.sh https://split-echo.cloud.ogenki.io 2Number of requests for echo-1: 95 3Number of requests for echo-2: 5 Headers modifications It is also possible to change HTTP Headers: to add, modify, or delete them. These modifications can be applied to either request or response headers through the use of filters in the HTTPRoute manifest.\nFor instance, we will add a Header to the request.\n1apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: HTTPRoute 3metadata: 4 name: echo-1 5 namespace: echo 6spec: 7... 8 rules: 9 - matches: 10 - path: 11 type: PathPrefix 12 value: /req-header-add 13 filters: 14 - type: RequestHeaderModifier 15 requestHeaderModifier: 16 add: 17 - name: foo 18 value: bar 19 backendRefs: 20 - name: echo-1-echo-server 21 port: 80 22... This command allows to that the header is indeed added:\n1curl -s https://echo.cloud.ogenki.io/req-header-add | jq \u0026#39;.request.headers\u0026#39; 2{ 3 \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;echo.cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34;, 4 \u0026#34;user-agent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;curl/8.2.1\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;accept\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*/*\u0026#34;, 6 \u0026#34;x-forwarded-for\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;81.220.234.254\u0026#34;, 7 \u0026#34;x-forwarded-proto\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https\u0026#34;, 8 \u0026#34;x-envoy-external-address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;81.220.234.254\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;x-request-id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;320ba4d2-3bd6-4c2f-8a97-74296a9f3f26\u0026#34;, 10 \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34; 11} 🔒 Assign the proper permissions GAPI offers a clear permission-sharing model between the traffic routing infrastructure (managed by cluster administrators) and the applications (managed by developers).\nThe availability of multiple custom resources allows to use Kubernete's RBAC configuration to assign permissions in a declarative way. I've added a few examples which have no effect in my demo cluster but might give you an idea.\nThe configuration below grants members of the developers group the ability to manage HTTPRoutes within the echo namespace, while only providing them read access to the Gateways.\n1--- 2apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 3kind: Role 4metadata: 5 namespace: echo 6 name: gapi-developer 7rules: 8 - apiGroups: [\u0026#34;gateway.networking.k8s.io\u0026#34;] 9 resources: [\u0026#34;httproutes\u0026#34;] 10 verbs: [\u0026#34;*\u0026#34;] 11 - apiGroups: [\u0026#34;gateway.networking.k8s.io\u0026#34;] 12 resources: [\u0026#34;gateways\u0026#34;] 13 verbs: [\u0026#34;get\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;list\u0026#34;] 14--- 15apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 16kind: RoleBinding 17metadata: 18 name: gapi-developer 19 namespace: echo 20subjects: 21 - kind: Group 22 name: \u0026#34;developers\u0026#34; 23 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io 24roleRef: 25 kind: Role 26 name: gapi-developer 27 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io 🤔 A somewhat unclear scope at first glance One could be confused with what's commonly referred to as an API Gateway. A section of the FAQ has been created to clarify its difference with the Gateway API. Although GAPI offers features typically found in an API Gateway, it primarily serves as a specific implementation for Kubernetes. However, the choice of this name can indeed cause confusion.\nMoreover please note that this article focuses solely on inbound traffic, termed north-south, traditionally managed by Ingress Controllers. This traffic is actually GAPI's initial scope. A recent initiative named GAMMA aims to also handle east-west routing, which will standardize certain features commonly provided by Service Meshes solutions in the future. (See this article for more details).\n💭 Final thoughts To be honest, I've known about the Gateway API for some time. Although I've read a few articles, I hadn't truly dived deep. I'd think, \u0026quot;Why bother? My Ingress Controller works, and there's a learning curve with this.\u0026quot;\nGAPI is on the rise and nearing its GA release. Several projects have embraced it, and this API for managing traffic within Kubernetes will quickly become the standard.\nI must say, configuring GAPI felt intuitive and explicit ❤️. Its security model strikes a balance, empowering developers without compromising security. And the seamless infrastructure management? You can switch between implementations without touching the *Routes.\nWould I swap my Ingress Controller for Cilium today? Not yet, but it's on the horizon.\nIt's worth highlighting Cilium's broad range of capabilities: With Kubernetes surrounded by a plethora of tools, Cilium stands out, promising features like metrics, tracing, service-mesh, security, and, yes, Ingress Controller with GAPI.\nHowever, there are a few challenges to note:\nTCP and UDP support GRPC support The need to use a mutation rule to configure cloud components (Github Issue). Many of the features discussed in this blog are still in the experimental stage. For instance, the extended functions, which have been supported since the most recent release at the time of my writing (v1.14.2). I attempted to set up a straightforward HTTP\u0026gt;HTTPS redirect but ran into this issue. Consequently, I expect some modifications to the API in the near future. While I've only scratched the surface of what Cilium's GAPI can offer (honestly, this post is already quite long 😜), I am hopeful that we can consider its use in production soon.

Using the Headlamp plugin now for displaying Flux resources.\nTerraform is probably the most used \u0026quot;Infrastructure As Code\u0026quot; tool for building, modifying, and versioning Cloud infrastructure changes. It is an Open Source project developed by Hashicorp that uses the HCL language to declare the desired state of Cloud resources. The state of the created resources is stored in a file called opentofu state.\nTerraform can be considered a \u0026quot;semi-declarative\u0026quot; tool as there is no built-in automatic reconciliation feature. There are several solutions to address this issue, but generally speaking, a modification will be applied using terraform apply. The code is actually written using the HCL configuration files (declarative), but the execution is done imperatively. As a result, there can be a drift between the declared and actual state (for example, a colleague who would have changed something directly into the console 😉).\n❓❓ So, how can I ensure that what is committed using Git is really applied. How to be notified if there is a change compared to the desired state and how to automatically apply what is in my code (GitOps)?\nThis is the promise of tf-controller, an Open Source Kubernetes operator from Weaveworks, tightly related to Flux (a GitOps engine from the same company). Flux is one of the solutions I really appreciate, that's why I invite you to have a look on my previous article\nInfo All the steps described in this article come from this Git repo\n🎯 Our target By following the steps in this article, we aim to achieve the following things:\nDeploy a Control plane EKS cluster. Long story short, it will host the Terraform controller that will be in charge of managing all the desired infrastructure components. Use Flux as the GitOps engine for all Kubernetes resources. Regarding the Terraform controller, we will see:\nHow to define dependencies between modules Creation of several AWS resources: Route53 Zone, ACM Certificate, network, EKS cluster. The different reconciliation options (automatic, requiring confirmation) How to backup and restore a Terraform state. 🛠️ Install the tf-controller ☸ The control plane In order to be able to use the Kubernetes controller tf-controller, we first need a Kubernetes cluster 😆. So we are going to create a control plane cluster using the terraform command line and EKS best practices.\nWarning It is crucial that this cluster is resilient, secure, and supervised as it will be responsible for managing all the AWS resources created subsequently.\nWithout going into detail, the control plane cluster was created using this code. That said, it is important to note that all application deployment operations are done using Flux.\nInfo By following the instructions in the README, an EKS cluster will be created but not only! Indeed, it is required to give permissions to the Terraform controller so it will able to apply infrastructure changes. Furthermore, Flux must be installed and configured to apply the configuration defined here.\nWe end up with several components installed and configured:\nThe almost unavoidable addons: aws-loadbalancer-controller and external-dns IRSA roles for these same components are installed using tf-controller Prometheus / Grafana monitoring stack. external-secrets to be able to retrieve sensitive data from AWS secretsmanager. To demonstrate all this after a few minutes the web interface for Flux is accessible via the URL gitops-\u0026lt;cluster_name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;domain_name\u0026gt;\nStill you should check that Flux is working properly\n1aws eks update-kubeconfig --name controlplane-0 --alias controlplane-0 2Updated context controlplane-0 in /home/smana/.kube/config 1flux check 2... 3✔ all checks passed 4 5flux get kustomizations 6NAME REVISION SUSPENDED READY MESSAGE 7flux-config main@sha1:e2cdaced False True Applied revision: main@sha1:e2cdaced 8flux-system main@sha1:e2cdaced False True Applied revision: main@sha1:e2cdaced 9infrastructure main@sha1:e2cdaced False True Applied revision: main@sha1:e2cdaced 10security main@sha1:e2cdaced False True Applied revision: main@sha1:e2cdaced 11tf-controller main@sha1:e2cdaced False True Applied revision: main@sha1:e2cdaced 12... 📦 The Helm chart and Flux Now that the control plane cluster is available we can add the Terraform controller and this is just the matter of using the Helm chart as follows.\nWe must declare the its Source first:\nsource.yaml\n1apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 2kind: HelmRepository 3metadata: 4 name: tf-controller 5spec: 6 interval: 30m 7 url: https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller Then we need to define the HelmRelease:\nrelease.yaml\n1apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1 2kind: HelmRelease 3metadata: 4 name: tf-controller 5spec: 6 releaseName: tf-controller 7 chart: 8 spec: 9 chart: tf-controller 10 sourceRef: 11 kind: HelmRepository 12 name: tf-controller 13 namespace: flux-system 14 version: \u0026#34;0.12.0\u0026#34; 15 interval: 10m0s 16 install: 17 remediation: 18 retries: 3 19 values: 20 resources: 21 limits: 22 memory: 1Gi 23 requests: 24 cpu: 200m 25 memory: 500Mi 26 runner: 27 serviceAccount: 28 annotations: 29 eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: \u0026#34;arn:aws:iam::${aws_account_id}:role/tfcontroller_${cluster_name}\u0026#34; When this change is actually written into Git, the HelmRelease will be deployed and the tf-controller started:\n1kubectl get hr -n flux-system 2NAME AGE READY STATUS 3tf-controller 67m True Release reconciliation succeeded 4 5kubectl get po -n flux-system -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=tf-controller 6NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE 7tf-controller-7ffdc69b54-c2brg 1/1 Running 0 2m6s In this demo, there are already a several AWS resources declared. Therefore, after a few minutes, the cluster takes care of creating these: Info Although the majority of operations are performed declaratively or via the CLIs kubectl and flux, another tool allows to manage Terraform resources: tfctl\n🚀 Apply a change One of the Terraform's best practices is to use modules. A module is a set of logically linked Terraform resources bundled into a single reusable unit. They allow to abstract complexity, take inputs, perform specific actions, and produce outputs.\nYou can create your own modules and make them available as Sources or use the many modules shared and maintained by communities. You just need to specify a few variables in order to fit to your context.\nWith tf-controller, the first step is therefore to define the Source of the module. Here we are going to configure the AWS base networking components (vpc, subnets...) using the terraform-aws-vpc module.\n1apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 2kind: GitRepository 3metadata: 4 name: terraform-aws-vpc 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 interval: 30s 8 ref: 9 tag: v5.0.0 10 url: https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc Then we can make use of this Source within a Terraform resource:\nvpc/dev.yaml\n1apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha2 2kind: Terraform 3metadata: 4 name: vpc-dev 5spec: 6 interval: 8m 7 path: . 8 destroyResourcesOnDeletion: true # You wouldn\u0026#39;t do that on a prod env ;) 9 storeReadablePlan: human 10 sourceRef: 11 kind: GitRepository 12 name: terraform-aws-vpc 13 namespace: flux-system 14 vars: 15 - name: name 16 value: vpc-dev 17 - name: cidr 18 value: \u0026#34;10.42.0.0/16\u0026#34; 19 - name: azs 20 value: 21 - \u0026#34;eu-west-3a\u0026#34; 22 - \u0026#34;eu-west-3b\u0026#34; 23 - \u0026#34;eu-west-3c\u0026#34; 24 - name: private_subnets 25 value: 26 - \u0026#34;10.42.0.0/19\u0026#34; 27 - \u0026#34;10.42.32.0/19\u0026#34; 28 - \u0026#34;10.42.64.0/19\u0026#34; 29 - name: public_subnets 30 value: 31 - \u0026#34;10.42.96.0/24\u0026#34; 32 - \u0026#34;10.42.97.0/24\u0026#34; 33 - \u0026#34;10.42.98.0/24\u0026#34; 34 - name: enable_nat_gateway 35 value: true 36 - name: single_nat_gateway 37 value: true 38 - name: private_subnet_tags 39 value: 40 \u0026#34;kubernetes.io/role/elb\u0026#34;: 1 41 \u0026#34;karpenter.sh/discovery\u0026#34;: dev 42 - name: public_subnet_tags 43 value: 44 \u0026#34;kubernetes.io/role/elb\u0026#34;: 1 45 writeOutputsToSecret: 46 name: vpc-dev In summary: the terraform code from the terraform-aws-vpc source is applied using the variables defined within vars.\nThere are then several parameters that influence the tf-controller behavior. The main parameters that control how modifications are applied are .spec.approvePlan and .spec.autoApprove\n🚨 Drift detection Setting spec.approvePlan to disable only notifies that the current state of resources has drifted from the Terraform code. This allows you to choose when and how to apply the changes.\nNote This is worth noting that there is a missing section on notifications: Drift, pending plans, reconciliation problems. I'm trying to identify possible methods (preferably with Prometheus) and update this article as soon as possible.\n🔧 Manual execution The given example above (vpc-dev) does not contain the .spec.approvePlan parameter and therefore inherits the default value which is false. In other words, the actual execution of changes (apply) is not done automatically.\nA plan is executed and will be waiting for validation:\n1tfctl get 2NAMESPACE NAME READY MESSAGE PLAN PENDING AGE 3... 4flux-system vpc-dev Unknown Plan generated: set approvePlan: \u0026#34;plan-v5.0.0-26c38a66f12e7c6c93b6a2ba127ad68981a48671\u0026#34; to approve this plan. true 2 minutes I also advise to configure the storeReadablePlan parameter to human.

To do this, set the .spec.autoApprove parameter to true.\nAll IRSA resources are configured in this way:\nexternal-secrets.yaml\n1piVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha2 2kind: Terraform 3metadata: 4 name: irsa-external-secrets 5spec: 6 approvePlan: auto 7 destroyResourcesOnDeletion: true 8 interval: 8m 9 path: ./modules/iam-role-for-service-accounts-eks 10 sourceRef: 11 kind: GitRepository 12 name: terraform-aws-iam 13 namespace: flux-system 14 vars: 15 - name: role_name 16 value: ${cluster_name}-external-secrets 17 - name: attach_external_secrets_policy 18 value: true 19 - name: oidc_providers 20 value: 21 main: 22 provider_arn: ${oidc_provider_arn} 23 namespace_service_accounts: [\u0026#34;security:external-secrets\u0026#34;] So if I make any change on the AWS console for example, it will be quickly overwritten by the one managed by tf-controller.\nInfo The deletion policy of components created by a Terraform resource is controlled by the setting destroyResourcesOnDeletion. By default anything created is not destroyed by the controller. If you want to destroy the resources when the Terraform object is deleted you must set this parameter to true.\nHere we want to be able to delete IRSA roles because they're tightly linked to a given EKS cluster\n🔄 Inputs/Outputs and modules dependencies When using Terraform, we often need to share data from one module to another. This is done using the outputs that are defined within modules. So we need a way to store them somewhere and import them into another module.\nLet's take again the given example above (vpc-dev). We can see at the bottom of the YAML file, the following block:\n1... 2 writeOutputsToSecret: 3 name: vpc-dev When this resource is applied, we will get a message confirming that the outputs are available (\u0026quot;Outputs written\u0026quot;):\n1kubectl get tf -n flux-system vpc-dev 2NAME READY STATUS AGE 3vpc-dev True Outputs written: v5.0.0@sha1:26c38a66f12e7c6c93b6a2ba127ad68981a48671 17m Indeed this module exports many information (126).\n1kubectl get secrets -n flux-system vpc-dev 2NAME TYPE DATA AGE 3vpc-dev Opaque 126 15s 4 5kubectl get secret -n flux-system vpc-dev --template=\u0026#39;{{.data.vpc_id}}\u0026#39; | base64 -d 6vpc-0c06a6d153b8cc4db Some of these are then used to create a dev EKS cluster.

Here is an example of the steps to take so that I can restore the state of these resources when I use this demo.\nNote This is a manual procedure to demonstrate the behavior of tf-controller with respect to state files. By default, these tfstates are stored in secrets, but we would prefer to configure a GCS or S3 backend.\nThe initial creation of the demo environment allowed me to save the state files (tfstate) as follows.\n1WORKSPACE=\u0026#34;default\u0026#34; 2STACK=\u0026#34;route53-cloud-hostedzone\u0026#34; 3BACKUPDIR=\u0026#34;${HOME}/tf-controller-backup\u0026#34; 4 5mkdir -p ${BACKUPDIR} 6 7kubectl get secrets -n flux-system tfstate-${WORKSPACE}-${STACK} -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.tfstate}\u0026#39; | \\ 8base64 -d \u0026gt; ${BACKUPDIR}/${WORKSPACE}-${STACK}.tfstate.gz When the cluster is created again, tf-controller tries to create the zone because the state file is empty.\n1tfctl get 2NAMESPACE NAME READY MESSAGE PLAN PENDING AGE 3... 4flux-system route53-cloud-hostedzone Unknown Plan generated: set approvePlan: \u0026#34;plan-main@sha1:345394fb4a82b9b258014332ddd556dde87f73ab\u0026#34; to approve this plan. true 16 minutes 5 6tfctl show plan route53-cloud-hostedzone 7 8Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution 9plan.

Indeed I want to highlight two features that I hadn't explored until now and that are very useful!\nVariable Substitution When Flux is initialized, some cluster-specific Kustomization files are applied. It is possible to specify variable substitutions within these files, so that they can be used in all resources deployed by this Kustomization. This helps to minimize code duplication.\nI recently discovered the efficiency of this feature. Here is how I use it:\nThe Terraform code that creates an EKS cluster also generates a ConfigMap that contains cluster-specific variables such as the cluster name, as well as all the parameters that vary between clusters.\nflux.tf\n1resource \u0026#34;kubernetes_config_map\u0026#34; \u0026#34;flux_clusters_vars\u0026#34; { 2 metadata { 3 name = \u0026#34;eks-${var.cluster_name}-vars\u0026#34; 4 namespace = \u0026#34;flux-system\u0026#34; 5 } 6 7 data = { 8 cluster_name = var.cluster_name 9 oidc_provider_arn = module.eks.oidc_provider_arn 10 aws_account_id = data.aws_caller_identity.this.account_id 11 region = var.region 12 environment = var.env 13 vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id 14 } 15 depends_on = [flux_bootstrap_git.this] 16} As mentioned previously, variable substitutions are defined in the Kustomization files. Let's take a concrete example. Below, we define the Kustomization that deploys all the resources controlled by the tf-controller. Here, we declare the eks-controlplane-0-vars ConfigMap that was generated during the EKS cluster creation.\ninfrastructure.yaml\n1apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 2kind: Kustomization 3metadata: 4 name: tf-custom-resources 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 prune: true 8 interval: 4m0s 9 path: ./infrastructure/controlplane-0/opentofu/custom-resources 10 postBuild: 11 substitute: 12 domain_name: \u0026#34;cloud.ogenki.io\u0026#34; 13 substituteFrom: 14 - kind: ConfigMap 15 name: eks-controlplane-0-vars 16 - kind: Secret 17 name: eks-controlplane-0-vars 18 optional: true 19 sourceRef: 20 kind: GitRepository 21 name: flux-system 22 dependsOn: 23 - name: tf-controller Finally, below is an example of a Kubernetes resource that makes use of it. This single manifest can be used by all clusters!.\nexternal-dns/helmrelease.yaml\n1apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1 2kind: HelmRelease 3metadata: 4 name: external-dns 5spec: 6... 7 values: 8 global: 9 imageRegistry: public.ecr.aws 10 fullnameOverride: external-dns 11 aws: 12 region: ${region} 13 zoneType: \u0026#34;public\u0026#34; 14 batchChangeSize: 1000 15 domainFilters: [\u0026#34;${domain_name}\u0026#34;] 16 logFormat: json 17 txtOwnerId: \u0026#34;${cluster_name}\u0026#34; 18 serviceAccount: 19 annotations: 20 eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: \u0026#34;arn:aws:iam::${aws_account_id}:role/${cluster_name}-external-dns\u0026#34; This will reduce significantly the number of overlays that were used to patch with cluster-specific parameters.\nWeb UI (Weave GitOps) In my previous article on Flux, I mentioned one of its downsides (when compared to its main competitor, ArgoCD): the lack of a Web interface. While I am a command line guy, this is sometimes useful to have a consolidated view and the ability to perform some operations with just a few clicks \u0026#x1f5b1;\u0026#xfe0f;\nThis is now possible with Weave GitOps! Of course, it is not comparable to ArgoCD's UI, but the essentials are there: pausing reconciliation, visualizing manifests, dependencies, events...\nThere is also the VSCode plugin as an alternative.\n💭 Final thoughts One might say \u0026quot;yet another infrastructure management tool from Kubernetes\u0026quot;. Well this is true but despite a few minor issues faced along the way, which I shared on the project's Git repo, I really enjoyed the experience. tf-controller provides a concrete answer to a common question: how to manage our infrastructure like we manage our code?\nI really like the GitOps approach applied to infrastructure, and I had actually written an article on Crossplane. tf-controller tackles the problem from a different angle: using Terraform directly. This means that we can leverage our existing knowledge and code. There's no need to learn a new way of declaring our resources. This is an important criterion to consider because migrating to a new tool when you already have an existing infrastructure represents a significant effort. However, I would also add that tf-controller is only targeted at Flux users, which restricts its target audience.\nCurrently, I'm using a combination of Terraform, Terragrunt and RunAtlantis. tf-controller could become a serious alternative: We've talked about the value of Kustomize combined with variable substitions to avoid code deduplication. The project's roadmap also aims to display plans in pull-requests. Another frequent need is to pass sensitive information to modules. Using a Terraform resource, we can inject variables from Kubernetes secrets. This makes it possible to use common secrets management tools, such as external-secrets, sealed-secrets ...\nSo, I encourage you to try tf-controller yourself, and perhaps even contribute to it 🙂\nNote The demo I used create quite a few resources, some of which are quite critical (like the network). So, keep in mind that this is just for the demo! I suggest taking a gradual approach if you plan to implement it: start by using drift detection, then create simple resources. I also took some shortcuts in terms of security that should be avoided, such as giving admin rights to the controller.

This database is a requirement for a ticket reservation software named Alf.io that's being used for an upcoming event: The Kubernetes Community Days France. (By the way you're welcome to submit a talk 👐, the CFP closes soon).\nI was specifically looking for a cloud-agnostic solution, with emphasis on ease of use. I was already familiar with several Kubernetes operators, and I ended up evaluating a fairly new kid on the block: CloudNativePG.\nCloudNativePG is the Kubernetes operator that covers the full lifecycle of a highly available PostgreSQL database cluster with a primary/standby architecture, using native streaming replication.\nIt has been created by the company EnterpriseDB, who submitted it to the CNCF in order to join the Sandbox projects.\n🎯 Our target I'm going to give you an introduction to the main CloudNativePG features. The plan is to:\ncreate a PostgreSQL database on a GKE cluster, add a standby instance, run a few resiliency tests. We will also see how it behaves in terms of performances and what are the observability tools available. Finally we'll have a look to the backup/restore methods.\nInfo In this article, we will create and update everything manually; but in production, we probably should use a GitOps engine, for instance Flux (which has been covered in a previous article).\nIf you want to see a complete end-to-end example, you can look at the KCD France infrastructure repository.\nAll the manifests shown in this article can be found in this repository.\n\u0026#x2611;\u0026#xfe0f; Requirements \u0026#x1f4e5; Tooling gcloud SDK: we're going to deploy on Google Cloud (specifically, on GKE) and we will need to create a few resources in our GCP project; so we'll need the Google Cloud SDK and CLI. If needed, you can install and configure it using this documentation.\nkubectl plugin: to facilitate cluster management, CloudNativePG comes with a handy kubectl plugin that gives insights of your PostgreSQL instance and allows to perform some operations. It can be installed using krew as follows:\n1kubectl krew install cnpg ☁️ Create the Google cloud requirements Before creating our PostgreSQL instance, we need to configure a few things:\nWe need a Kubernetes cluster. This article assumes that you have already taken care of provisioning a GKE cluster. We'll create a bucket to store the backups and WAL files. We'll grant permissions to our pods so that they can write to that bucket. Create the bucket using gcloud CLI\n1gcloud storage buckets create --location=eu --default-storage-class=coldline gs://cnpg-ogenki 2Creating gs://cnpg-ogenki/... 3 4gcloud storage buckets describe gs://cnpg-ogenki 5[...] 6name: cnpg-ogenki 7owner: 8 entity: project-owners-xxxx0008 9projectNumber: \u0026#39;xxx00008\u0026#39; 10rpo: DEFAULT 11selfLink: https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/cnpg-ogenki 12storageClass: STANDARD 13timeCreated: \u0026#39;2022-10-15T19:27:54.364000+00:00\u0026#39; 14updated: \u0026#39;2022-10-15T19:27:54.364000+00:00\u0026#39; Now, we're going to give the permissions to the pods (PostgreSQL server) to write/read from the bucket using Workload Identity.\nNote The GKE cluster should be configured with Workload Identity enabled. Check your cluster configuration, you should get something with this command:\n1gcloud container clusters describe \u0026lt;cluster_name\u0026gt; --format json --zone \u0026lt;zone\u0026gt; | jq .workloadIdentityConfig 2{ 3 \u0026#34;workloadPool\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{ gcp_project }}.svc.id.goog\u0026#34; 4} Create a Google Cloud service account\n1gcloud iam service-accounts create cloudnative-pg --project={{ gcp_project }} 2Created service account [cloudnative-pg].

We won't cover its installation in this article. If you want to see how to install it \u0026quot;the GitOps way\u0026quot; you can check this example.\nTo scrape our instance's metrics, we need to create a PodMonitor.\n1apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 2kind: PodMonitor 3metadata: 4 labels: 5 prometheus-instance: main 6 name: cnpg-ogenki 7 namespace: demo 8spec: 9 namespaceSelector: 10 matchNames: 11 - demo 12 podMetricsEndpoints: 13 - port: metrics 14 selector: 15 matchLabels: 16 postgresql: ogenki We can then add the Grafana dashboard available here.\nFinally, you may want to configure alerts and you can create a PrometheusRule using these rules.\n\u0026#x1f525; Performances and benchmark Info Update: It is now possible to use the cnpg plugin. The following method is deprecated, I'll update it asap.\nThis is worth running a performance test in order to know the limits of your current server and keep a baseline for further improvements.\nNote When it comes to performance there are many improvement areas we can work on. It mostly depends on the target we want to achieve. Indeed we don't want to waste time and money for performance we'll likely never need.\nHere are the main things to look at:\nPostgreSQL configuration tuning Compute resources (cpu and memory) Disk type IOPS, local storage (local-volume-provisioner), Dedicated disks for WAL and PG_DATA Connection pooling PGBouncer. The CloudNativePG comes with a CRD Pooler to handle that. Database optimization, analyzing the query plans using explain, use the extension pg_stat_statement ... First of all we'll add labels to the nodes in order to run the pgbench command on different machines than the ones hosting the database.\n1PG_NODE=$(kubectl get po -n demo -l postgresql=ogenki,role=primary -o jsonpath={.items[0].spec.nodeName}) 2kubectl label node ${PG_NODE} workload=postgresql 3node/gke-kcdfrance-main-np-0e87115b-vlzm labeled 4 5 6# Choose any other node different than the ${PG_NODE} 7kubectl label node gke-kcdfrance-main-np-0e87115b-p5d7 workload=pgbench 8node/gke-kcdfrance-main-np-0e87115b-p5d7 labeled And we'll deploy the Helm chart as follows\n1git clone git@github.com:EnterpriseDB/cnp-bench.git 2cd cnp-bench 3 4cat \u0026gt; pgbench-benchmark/myvalues.yaml \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF 5cnp: 6 existingCluster: true 7 existingHost: ogenki-rw 8 existingCredentials: cnpg-mydb-superuser 9 existingDatabase: mydb 10 11pgbench: 12 # Node where to run pgbench 13 nodeSelector: 14 workload: pgbench 15 initialize: true 16 scaleFactor: 1 17 time: 600 18 clients: 10 19 jobs: 1 20 skipVacuum: false 21 reportLatencies: false 22EOF 23 24helm upgrade --install -n demo pgbench -f pgbench-benchmark/myvalues.yaml pgbench-benchmark/ Info There are different services depending on wether you want to read and write or read only.\n1kubectl get ep -n demo 2NAME ENDPOINTS AGE 3ogenki-any 10.64.1.136:5432,10.64.1.3:5432 15d 4ogenki-r 10.64.1.136:5432,10.64.1.3:5432 15d 5ogenki-ro 10.64.1.136:5432 15d 6ogenki-rw 10.64.1.3:5432 15d 1kubectl logs -n demo job/pgbench-pgbench-benchmark -f 2Defaulted container \u0026#34;pgbench\u0026#34; out of: pgbench, wait-for-cnp (init), pgbench-init (init) 3pgbench (14.1, server 14.5 (Debian 14.5-2.pgdg110+2)) 4starting vacuum...end. 5transaction type: \u0026lt;builtin: TPC-B (sort of)\u0026gt; 6scaling factor: 1 7query mode: simple 8number of clients: 10 9number of threads: 1 10duration: 600 s 11number of transactions actually processed: 545187 12latency average = 11.004 ms 13initial connection time = 111.585 ms 14tps = 908.782896 (without initial connection time) 💽 Backup and Restore Note Writing backups and WAL files to the GCP bucket is possible because we gave the permissions using an annotation in the pod's serviceaccount\n1 serviceAccountTemplate: 2 metadata: 3 annotations: 4 iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: cloudnative-pg@{{ gcp_project }}.iam.gserviceaccount.com We can first trigger an on-demand backup using the custom resource Backup\n1apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 2kind: Backup 3metadata: 4 name: ogenki-now 5 namespace: demo 6spec: 7 cluster: 8 name: ogenki 1kubectl apply -f backup.yaml 2backup.postgresql.cnpg.io/ogenki-now created 3 4kubectl get backup -n demo 5NAME AGE CLUSTER PHASE ERROR 6ogenki-now 36s ogenki completed If you take a look at the Google Cloud Storage content you'll see an new directory that stores the base backups\n1gcloud storage ls gs://cnpg-ogenki/ogenki/base 2gs://cnpg-ogenki/ogenki/base/20221023T130327/ But most of the time we would want to have a scheduled backup.

However choosing a database solution is a tough decision. Depending on the use case, the company constraints, the criticity of the application and the ops teams skills, there are plenty of options: Cloud managed databases, traditional bare metal installations, building the architecture with an Infrastructure As Code tool...\nWe may also consider using Crossplane and composition to give an opinionated way of declaring managed databases in cloud providers but that requires more configuration.\nCloudNativePG shines by its simplicity: it is easy to run and easy to understand. Furthermore the documentation is excellent (one of the best I ever seen!), especially for such a young open source project (Hopefuly this will help in the CNCF Sandbox acceptance process 🤞).\nIf you want to learn more about it, there was a presentation on about it at KubeCon NA 2022.\n","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/cnpg/","section":"post","tags":["data"],"title":"`CloudNativePG`: An easy way to run PostgreSQL on Kubernetes"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/data/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Data"},{"body":"In a previous article, we've seen how to use Crossplane so that we can manage cloud resources the same way as our applications. \u0026#x2764;\u0026#xfe0f; Declarative approach! There were several steps and command lines in order to get everything working and reach our target to provision a dev Kubernetes cluster.\nHere we'll achieve exactly the same thing but we'll do that in the GitOps way. According to the OpenGitOps working group there are 4 GitOps principles:\nThe desired state of our system must be expressed declaratively. This state must be stored in a versioning system. Changes are pulled and applied automatically in the target platform whenever the desired state changes. If, for any reason, the current state is modified, it will be automatically reconciled with the desired state. There are several GitOps engine options. The most famous ones are ArgoCD and Flux. We won't compare them here. I chose Flux because I like its composable architecture with different controllers, each one handling a core Flux feature (GitOps toolkit).\nLearn more about GitOps toolkit components here.\n🎯 Our target Here we want to declare our desired infrastructure components only by adding git changes.

In order to securely store secrets in a git repository the GitOps way we'll make use of SealedSecrets. It uses a custom resource definition named SealedSecrets in order to encrypt the Kubernetes secret at the client side then the controller is in charge of decrypting and generating the expected secret in the cluster.\n\u0026#x1f6e0;\u0026#xfe0f; Deploy the controller using Helm The first thing to do is to declare the kustomization that handles all the security tools.\nclusters/k3d-crossplane/security.yaml\n1apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 2kind: Kustomization 3metadata: 4 name: security 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 prune: true 8 interval: 4m0s 9 sourceRef: 10 kind: GitRepository 11 name: flux-system 12 path: ./security/k3d-crossplane 13 healthChecks: 14 - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1 15 kind: HelmRelease 16 name: sealed-secrets 17 namespace: kube-system Info A Kustomization is a custom resource that comes with Flux. It basically points to a set of Kubernetes resources managed with kustomize The above security kustomization points to a local directory where the kustomize resources are.\n1... 2spec: 3 path: ./security/k3d-crossplane 4... Note This is worth noting that there are two types on kustomizations. That can be confusing when you start playing with Flux.\nOne managed by flux's kustomize controller. Its API is kustomization.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io The other kustomization.kustomize.config.k8s.io is for the kustomize overlay The kustomization.yaml file is always used for the kustomize overlay. Flux itself doesn't need this overlay in all cases, but if you want to use features of a Kustomize overlay you will occasionally need to create it in order to access them. It provides instructions to the Kustomize CLI.\nWe will deploy SealedSecrets using the Helm chart. So we need to declare the source of this chart. Using the kustomize overlay system, we'll first create the base files that will be inherited at the cluster level.\nsecurity/base/sealed-secrets/source.yaml\n1apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 2kind: HelmRepository 3metadata: 4 name: sealed-secrets 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 interval: 30m 8 url: https://bitnami-labs.github.io/sealed-secrets Then we'll define the HelmRelease which references the above source.

I won't put the manifests here you'll find all of them in this repository. However it's important to understand that, in order to deploy and configure Crossplane properly we need to do that in a specific order. Indeed several CRD's (custom resource definitions) are required:\nFirst of all we'll install the crossplane controller. Then we'll configure the provider because the custom resource is now available thanks to the crossplane controller installation. Finally a provider installation deploys several CRDs that can be used to configure the provider itself and cloud resources. The dependencies between kustomizations can be controlled using the parameters dependsOn. Looking at the file clusters/k3d-crossplane/infrastructure.yaml, we can see for example that the kustomization infrastructure-custom-resources depends on the kustomization crossplane_provider which itself depends on crossplane-configuration....\n1--- 2apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 3kind: Kustomization 4metadata: 5 name: crossplane-provider 6spec: 7... 8 dependsOn: 9 - name: crossplane-core 10--- 11apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 12kind: Kustomization 13metadata: 14 name: crossplane-configuration 15spec: 16... 17 dependsOn: 18 - name: crossplane-provider 19--- 20apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 21kind: Kustomization 22metadata: 23 name: infrastructure-custom-resources 24spec: 25... 26 dependsOn: 27 - name: crossplane-configuration Commit and push the changes for the kustomisations to appear.

Our demo application can be deployed from scratch in seconds. 💭 final thoughts Flux is probably the tool I'm using the most on a daily basis. It's really amazing!\nWhen you get familiar with its concepts and the command line it becomes really easy to use and troubleshoot. You can use either Helm when a chart is available or Kustomize.\nHowever we faced a few issues:\nIt's not straightforward to find an efficient structure depending on the company needs. Especially when you have several Kubernetes controllers that depend on other CRDs. The Helm controller doesn't maintain a state of the Kubernetes resources deployed by the Helm chart. That means that if you delete a resource which has been deployed through a Helm chart, it won't be reconciled (It will change soon. Being discussed here) Flux doesn't provide itself a web UI and switching between CLIs (kubectl, flux ...) can be annoying from a developer perspective. (I'm going to test weave-gitops ) I've been using Flux in production for more than a year and we configured it with the image automation so that the only thing a developer has to do is to merge a pull request and the new version of the application is automatically deployed in the target cluster.\nI should probably give another try to ArgoCD in order to be able to compare these precisely 🤔.\n","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/devflux/","section":"post","tags":["gitops","devxp"],"title":"100% `GitOps` using Flux"},{"body":"Who am I?

It clearly doesn't have Terraform's community and maturity. We're still declaring our resources using the deletionPolicy: Orphan so that even if something goes wrong on the controller side the resource won't be deleted.\nFurthermore we limited to a specific list of usual AWS resources requested by our developers. Nevertheless our target has always been to empower developers and we had really positive feedback from them. That's the best indicator for us. As the project matures, we'll move more and more resources from Terraform to Crossplane.\nIMHO the key success of Crossplane depends on the providers maintenance and evolution. The Cloud providers interest and involvement is really important.\nIn our next article we'll see how to use a GitOps engine to run all the above steps.\n","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/post/crossplane_k3d/","section":"post","tags":["kubernetes","infrastructure"],"title":"My Kubernetes cluster (GKE) with `Crossplane`"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.ogenki.io/tags/local/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Local"},{"body":"In order to install binaries and to be able to switch from a version to another I like to use asdf.\n\u0026#x1f4e5; Installation The recommended installation is to use Git as follows\n1git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.10.0 Then depending on your shell here are the remaining steps to follow\n1. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh And you may want to configure the shell completion\n1. $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash \u0026#x1f680; Let's take an example List all available plugins and look for k3d\n1asdf plugin-list-all | grep k3d 2k3d https://github.com/spencergilbert/asdf-k3d.git Let's install k3d\n1asdf plugin-add k3d Check the versions available\n1asdf list-all k3d| tail -n 3 25.4.0-dev.3 35.4.0 45.4.1 We'll install the latest version\n1asdf install k3d latest 2* Downloading k3d release 5.4.1... 3k3d 5.4.1 installation was successful!

There are several ways to expose an app, here we'll use the easiest way: Create a service and run a port-forward.\nThe following command will create a service which will be in charge of forwarding calls through the tcp port 9898\n1kubectl expose deploy podinfo --port 9898 2service/podinfo exposed We can get more information on the service as follows\n1kubectl get svc -o yaml podinfo 2apiVersion: v1 3kind: Service 4metadata: 5 labels: 6 app: podinfo 7 name: podinfo 8 namespace: foo 9spec: 10 clusterIP: 10.43.47.17 11 clusterIPs: 12 - 10.43.47.17 13 ipFamilies: 14 - IPv4 15 ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack 16 ports: 17 - port: 9898 18 selector: 19 app: podinfo A service uses the selector above to identify on which pod to forward the traffic and usually creates the endpoints accordingly.\n1kubectl get po -l app=podinfo 2NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE 3podinfo-7fbb45ccfc-bkm8n 1/1 Running 1 146m 4podinfo-7fbb45ccfc-sbqht 1/1 Running 2 18h 5... 6 7kubectl get endpoints 8NAME ENDPOINTS AGE 9podinfo 10.42.0.16:9898,10.42.0.17:9898,10.42.1.18:9898 + 3 more... 92s The service we've created has an IP that's only accessible from within the cluster. Using the port-forward command we're able to forward the traffic from our local machine to the application (through the API server).
